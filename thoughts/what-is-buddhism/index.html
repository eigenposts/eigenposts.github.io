  <p><em>Lies I have found useful</em></p>
<p>There is only ever one thing; Buddhism is learning to fall in love with that thing. When we fall in love with the idea of a thing, we suffer as we discover that the thing does not match the idea. This is the importance of nondual realization in Buddhism. If we break our habit of conceptualizing everything we encounter, we can suffer much less because we will not expect things to be other than they are.</p>
<p>There is alignment and there is orientation; Buddhism is concerned with both. If we are not aligned, the different parts of ourselves will want to do different things. We may be very cruel, even violent, towards ourselves before we learn to align. Orientation is what we align towards - it is what we want to be and do in our lives. This encapsulates ethics, proper understanding, and wisdom.</p>
<p>Buddhism is about freedom. A free person is expansive, open, playful, vulnerable. An unfree person is collapsed, constricted, and maybe habitually defensive. One of the mental habits that most greatly increases unfreeness is <em>tanha</em>, which is a sort of collapsing of the mind around a mental formation. Romeo Stevens claims that a Buddhist is someone who has realized firsthand that <em>tanha</em> causes <em>dukkha</em> (usually translated as &ldquo;suffering&rdquo; or &ldquo;unsatisfactoriness&rdquo;, though Stevens <a href="https://neuroticgradientdescent.blogspot.com/2020/01/mistranslating-buddha.html">doesn&rsquo;t like either</a> and prefers &ldquo;a difficult emptiness&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Buddhism is a religion. Most Buddhists don&rsquo;t have a meditation practice, and even fewer seek enlightenment. In most places with a lot of Buddhists, Buddhism is part of the social structure; there are specific norms around how to behave towards monks and people on pilgrimage. In many places, Buddhist sorcerors were and probably are particularly valued because they are seen as having especially useful magic. Many Buddhists believe in afterlives not so different from Christian concepts of Heaven (the Pure Land of the Buddha) and Hell (the Hell Realms). More western-friendly interpretations of these concepts have them as modes of experience rather than afterlives, but this is not how they are understood by millions of people around the world.</p>
<p>Buddhism is simply a collection of techniques. The Buddha and his contemporaries, who died before Galileo and Francis Bacon and even Aristotle were even born, had a very practical approach to the truth: what works is true. The Buddha is known to have contradicted himself when teaching different students, because different people need to hear different things to make spiritual progress.</p>
