  <p><em>Why I don&rsquo;t recommend supplementing choline</em></p>
<p>I was reading Aaron Bergman&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.aaronbergman.net/p/stuff-i-buy-and-use">Stuff I Buy and Use</a> a few days ago and saw that he recommends supplementing choline. I&rsquo;d heard about this previously but hadn&rsquo;t looked into it yet, and the tl;dr for this post is that I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s particularly well-supported by the evidence unless you&rsquo;re pregnant or a very young child (&lt;3 years old). I do want to give a shoutout to <a href="https://elicit.org/">Elicit</a> for building a very cool product that lets me quickly browse through literature for fields I don&rsquo;t understand well. It&rsquo;s not a mature tool, but I think it&rsquo;ll be incredible in a couple of years.</p>
<p>There seems to be a fair bit of evidence suggesting that choline supplementation is helpful for young children. This was observed in rats at least as early as <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Pre-and-postnatal-choline-supplementation-produces-Meck-Smith/48f89159d9997abbe11246e937ee6c5196bd9d3b">1988</a>. A 2021 <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-Systematic-Review-of-the-Dietary-Choline-Impact-a-G%C3%A1miz-Gallo/bc495374bc439801481d72b49376e2e2d637e004">meta-analysis</a> suggests possible mechanisms for this.</p>
<p>In humans, <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Effects-of-choline-on-health-across-the-life-a-Leermakers-Moreira/d7bee1f0cf2ac758ee862176dc139c6121285696">a 2015 meta-analysis</a> finds small to no effects of choline supplementation on a variety of health and performance factors. They find that it <em>might</em> improve cognition, but point out that high-quality interventional studies aren&rsquo;t available. <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Neurocognitive-effects-of-acute-choline-in-low%2C-and-Knott-Salle/855fe67ec38158c5f574c6938ded4acb3494f335">One RCT</a> was published earlier the same year, showing that choline supplementation seemed to improve cognition in people who performed poorly on a test and worsen cognition in people who performed well. However, this RCT had a sample size of just 24 people and I suspect what they measured was regression to the mean.</p>
<p>On the other hand, choline <em>does</em> seem to correlate with depressive symptoms according to <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Brain-choline-in-major-depression%3A-A-review-of-the-Riley-Renshaw/7f20b419e489b108471282cf910a2cacc01f85f0">this meta-analysis</a>. I&rsquo;ve had issues with depression and don&rsquo;t want more, so this would be enough to make me very cautious even though correlation doesn&rsquo;t, as we all know, imply causation.</p>
<p>This is already sort of enough for me to not take a supplement. Evidence for benefits is sparse and the risks seem pretty significant, relatively speaking. But as a final check, I got on the Nootropics subreddit and searched for choline. And results seem&hellip; pretty underwhelming. Most people say they didn&rsquo;t really feel anything, a couple of people said they did a little better on some of the supplements, and a couple people said they had significant depression. A skip for me. For what it&rsquo;s worth, creatine seems to have much better evidence for improving cognition, and it improves physical recovery, and it has no side effects that I know of. I&rsquo;m not sure why choline made Aaron&rsquo;s list and creatine didn&rsquo;t.</p>
