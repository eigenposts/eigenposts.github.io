  <p><em>Fear responses, okayness, and shrooms</em></p>
<p>In college, a friend and I were caught by campus police exploring a construction site. They threatened to arrest us and charge us with misdemeanor trespass, and eventually let us off with warnings. The school honor council ended up forcing us to write apology essays, and that was it. But, I&rsquo;m a little embarrassed to say, it was a traumatizing experience for me. If those cops had decided they didn&rsquo;t like us, I could have had a criminal record applying to grad schools. The honor council could have decided to expel us. That didn&rsquo;t happen, and I&rsquo;m sure the odds of it happening were always small, but for an hour one night, and for a couple of weeks after that, I felt completely powerless to affect my own future, and that experience stuck with me.</p>
<p>A couple of years later, I agreed to do mushrooms with my brother, and his plan was for us to go for a walk in a public park in the middle of Pittsburgh while we were high. I was uncomfortable potentially attracting more police attention, but I decided that this would be a good opportunity: this trip would be about working with my fear of powerlessness. So I took the shrooms and set my intention on finding a good way to work with my constrictions around power.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t bore you with every last detail of the trip. I became a god. I saw the concept of existence as a joke - not a bitter, ironic joke, but as the most sidesplittingly hilarious response you could possibly imagine to the grandeur of experience. I laughed uncontrollably until my brother&rsquo;s roommates came to ask if we had heard someone screaming in pain. Normal shrooms stuff. And then we went for a walk.</p>
<p>One of my favorite podcasts, <em>The Art of Accomplishment</em>, talks about the &ldquo;fear triangle,&rdquo; which is a modification of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle">Karpman drama triangle</a>. Stephen Karpman suggested that this triangle shows &ldquo;a type of destructive interaction that can occur among people in conflict,&rdquo; but it also gives a few common responses to fear generated by conflict. The three classic fear responses, fight, flight, and freeze, can also be mapped to patterns of behavior that AoA calls victim, savior, and bully.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Victim</strong> corresponds to freeze, and means that you respond to fear with helplessness. You feel stuck and powerless in situations that make you afraid, and you convince yourself that nothing can be done, even if you try as hard as you can. This allows you to avoid your feelings by shutting down.</li>
<li><strong>Savior</strong> corresponds to flight, and means that you try to fix others as a way of escaping your own experience. You tend to respond to difficult decisions by acting out of a sense of obligation or trying to solve other people&rsquo;s problems. This allows you to avoid your feelings by fleeing into someone else&rsquo;s experience.</li>
<li><strong>Bully</strong> corresponds with fight, and means that you respond to difficulty by feeling alone and betrayed, like it&rsquo;s you against the world. You insist that your problems are other people&rsquo;s fault and try to gain control over them in order to gain control over your own feelings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, my dysfunctional fear response of choice is Savior. I tend to intellectualize problems and I like to imagine that I&rsquo;m somehow more developed than other people, so I look for ways to educate or fix them rather than dealing with whatever is coming up for me. But when Savior doesn&rsquo;t work, I tend to go into Victim (see first paragraph).</p>
<p>According to <em>The Art of Accomplishment</em>, the healthier response to fear comes from a sense of &ldquo;empowerment.&rdquo; My summary of how they use that word is that it&rsquo;s a state in which you feel secure being yourself despite the potential consequences and have a sense of agency in the way you show up in the world. I think that&rsquo;s sort of symmetrical to what I experienced on shrooms, but I&rsquo;d like to describe it my way:</p>
<p>Walking through Pittsburgh with my brother, I felt a deep sense of okayness. Not in the sense that I believed everything would turn out the way I wanted it to, but in the sense that no matter what happened, I could be at peace with it. And because I could be at peace with anything happening, I felt tremendously permissive. Whenever my brother wanted to go somewhere or do something, I just thought, &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; As a test, I tried to work myself up by imagining the police arresting me for walking around very obviously high, and all I could think was, &ldquo;well, the police have gotta do what they&rsquo;ve gotta do, and I&rsquo;ve gotta do what I&rsquo;ve gotta do, I&rsquo;ll be okay with whatever comes out of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had no desire whatsoever to control anything, much less the behavior of others, even when it impacted me. I just wanted to show up authentically and have other people show up authentically too, and I was confident in the goodness of whatever happened as a result. Enlightenment is sometimes described as &ldquo;happiness independent of conditions,&rdquo; which is a phrasing I&rsquo;ve never loved because &lsquo;happiness&rsquo; is easy to interpret as something like &lsquo;positive hedonic tone,&rsquo; but now I feel like I&rsquo;ve seen what Shinzen Young means by this. I might rephrase it as &lsquo;agency over how you show up, independent of circumstances.&rsquo; If you have this agency, and know you have it, then your present and future circumstances will have much less power to affect you or your decisions.</p>
<p>My takeaway from this experience was not that material conditions don&rsquo;t matter. In the real world, material conditions matter. But I now appreciate that if you can make decisions that will impact your material conditions from a place of fundamental okayness, you will make better decisions that align with what you actually want instead of what you&rsquo;re scared of.</p>
