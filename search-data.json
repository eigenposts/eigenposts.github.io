                "body": "Review of The Math Academy Way, by Justin Skycak of Math Academy\nA bit over a year ago, I reviewed How Children Learn, one of the foundational books of the unschooling movement. In my review, I expressed a certain amount of doubt that unschooling was the right approach for teaching math:\nIn fact, I think there are some things (math being an excellent example) which we should expect to require years of effort before they become natural and useful, but which are ultimately too valuable to pass over. With enough skill, it is certainly possible to non-coercively guide children to learn an appropriate amount of math (which I’ll define as math up to calculus and linear algebra) under their own motivation; I have seen it happen. But, even as someone who mostly hangs out with engineers, I know perhaps three people who do math for fun (maybe closer to ten if you count relatively small amounts of math done incidentally for personal projects). I think the heuristic of being non-coercive can get you a long way, but it also leaves too much value on the table to be the whole story.\nThis is supported by the fact that in the ACX survey, unschooled participants had worse math SAT scores than traditionally schooled participants. In some sense this is completely expected: of course people raised in an environment that completely de-emphasizes standardized test performance will perform worse on standardized tests.\n\u0026hellip;. An alternative explanation of the observations in How Children Learn, fueled by a synthesis of these books, might be that children can’t learn well when they’re not in emotional regulation. This suggests that children might have greater tolerance for coerced learning activities (like math) if you give them plenty of opportunities to feel smart, capable, and in charge - before, during, and after the work they’re not as enthusiastic about.\nI generally try to steelman books in my reviews, because books can\u0026rsquo;t debate you back and it\u0026rsquo;s easy to dismiss a book as useless after you identify one or two bad ideas. But I recently read The Math Academy Way by Justin Skycak and it\u0026rsquo;s substantially changed my views on education (particularly, but not exclusively, math education). The Math Academy Way is many things: a manifesto, a giant piece of marketing material, and, above all, a Google Doc. You can find it here. I converted this to epub to read it on my iPad in December 2024, so this review won\u0026rsquo;t reflect changes after that date.\nThere are a few companies out there that promise to supercharge your child\u0026rsquo;s learning, sometimes in those exact words. I have experienced what I assume are the two most common types of private supplementary education: remedial tutoring and test preparation classes. But the most exciting types of private supplementary education don\u0026rsquo;t aim to help you eke out admission to that Ivy League school; they aim to create a generation of extraordinarily capable mathematicians, writers, and intellectuals of all stripes. One of these programs is Mentava, which focuses on teaching children to read when they\u0026rsquo;re very young (they say you should be able to use their program to have your kid reading at a basic level by age 4; kids adhering to the typical public school track reach this level closer to age 6-7). A two year head start by the time you\u0026rsquo;re four years old is seriously impressive. Math Academy is way more ambitious than this.\nMath Academy was founded by Jason Roberts, a dad who was coaching an after-school program. He discovered that he could teach a small group of talented fifth graders math up to calculus and they would understand it and perform well. Understandably, this was exciting to him; if most people ever do calculus, they do it in college or perhaps the end of high school. If every fifth grader in his after-school program could learn it, the obvious implication is that school is extremely bad at teaching math. The theory in The Math Academy Way is that we allow this state of affairs to persist for a number of reasons, but mostly because we don\u0026rsquo;t think about education properly.\nTalent Development As a foil to modern math education, consider modern athletic training: though reasonable people may gripe about everyone getting a trophy nowadays, the truth is that there are abundant opportunities for talented and motivated kids to compete and train in sports at high levels. As of my childhood, travel leagues for the most popular sports started as early as 8-10 years old, and there were also all-star leagues and, I assume, even more advanced opportunities. When we train children for these leagues, we optimize in a very clearheaded way for talent development, which Skycak presents in contrast to \u0026ldquo;traditional schooling.\u0026rdquo; If a coach is lots of fun but doesn\u0026rsquo;t help our kids get better at basketball, we understand that we have to make a choice between raising excellent athletes and giving our kids a fun experience. Probably because of the frequent, public competitions involved in athletics (a backstop), we don\u0026rsquo;t often see people fooling themselves into thinking that actually inferior training techniques are better than they are (admittedly, there\u0026rsquo;s also a selection effect here: people who do this are eventually out-competed and lose visibility). We observe similar dynamics in musicianship.\nThese differences are particularly stark in the domain of math. One reason for this is that math has uniquely long dependency chains as compared to other subjects. It\u0026rsquo;s perfectly possible, for example, to learn all about American history between the end of WWII and the beginning of the Cold War with a bare minimum of knowledge of even causally related topics, but it\u0026rsquo;s impossible to learn calculus without knowledge of trigonometry. Long dependency chains create perverse incentives for teachers, who are evaluated according to students\u0026rsquo; standardized test scores and punished (by complaints from parents and students) for teaching beyond those tests. Students are thus systematically underprepared for each successive math class, leading them to fall further behind unless they take their education into their own hands.\nOne interesting demonstration of this, which isn\u0026rsquo;t discussed in the book as far as I remember, comes from Bloom\u0026rsquo;s classic \u0026ldquo;two-sigma problem\u0026rdquo; paper. The most famous result is that the average student who receives one-on-one tutoring performs at the 98th percentile relative to the distribution of students who only receive conventional education in a 30-person class. But these curves also differ in another property: the tutored students exhibited a much lower standard deviation in their test scores. It looks to me like this may be because a substantial portion of the tutored students saturated the tests used for evaluation, but even based only on the left tail of student performance, there is a noticeable difference. This seems to validate the theory that student performance spreads out over time under conventional schooling based in part on the ability of the students to correct the gaps in their own knowledge, whereas tutoring largely eliminates this axis of variation.\nYou can also think about what happens at the right end of the bell curve. In math, excellent students are, at best, excused from class or accelerated by a grade. Imagine the equivalent of this for competitive sports: a coach identifies a talented athlete and either promotes him to play with older children (?) or excuses him from practice because he is already good enough (??!!). The promotion to play with older children is probably better than doing nothing, but it ignores an opportunity to nurture the player\u0026rsquo;s skill by paying extra attention to his training and form - it basically treats the player\u0026rsquo;s skill as a problem which causes boredom, and treats the boredom by introducing extra challenges. The most common outcome in sports and musicianship is to for coaches to nominate the child for private lessons and in some cases provide extra individual instruction on the side. This never happens in math class.\nOne reasonable question you might ask is: what if that\u0026rsquo;s just because math isn\u0026rsquo;t like sports or music? I feel like the Math Academy people (who are otherwise extremely thorough in rebutting possible counterarguments) overlook this a bit and maybe overuse the sports metaphors. Sports and musicianship seem to me to have a small set of extremely deep skills which require extensive practice to reach the point of perfection, whereas math seems like it has the opposite structure: a huge set of skills which are individually pretty easy to master but build on each other. It would make sense if math and sports benefited from different pedagogies. But from a first-principles perspective, it seems like math should benefit more from individualized instruction. If prerequisites are such an important part of math, it follows that the best thing to do when a math student gets a problem wrong is to figure out why and retrain them on the prerequisite knowledge they were missing: personalized instruction allows this, while even small group instruction makes it impossible. Meanwhile, athletic instruction can be relatively more straightforward (though I\u0026rsquo;m sure it\u0026rsquo;s highly personalized at elite levels). Having a problem dribbling? Practice dribbling. Or so I imagine, I was never an elite athlete.\nOne last point for this section is that colleges have a lot of leeway to do pretty much whatever they want (MIT has a pirate certificate, Brown lets you make up your own major, etc), but don\u0026rsquo;t seem to take education seriously. This is probably unsurprising to most people who attended large universities, but there are horror stories in the book about professors who try to implement a self-paced learning strategy called PSI (Personalized System of Instruction) in university classrooms:\n\u0026hellip; Avoiding a frontal attack, the chairman of the Psychology Department at Georgetown declared by fiat that something on the order of 50% of class time must be devoted to lecturing. By reducing the possibility of self-pacing to zero, this effectively eliminated PSI courses.\nHe issued this order on the grounds that in the context of lecturing ‘it is the dash of intellects in the classroom that informs the student.’ No data were presented on this point! The spectacle of purporting to defend scholarship while deciding the merits of instructional methods by assertion is silly.\nThere are also some good stories, including about MIT, which implemented an active learning system they called TEAL (Technology-Enhanced Active Learning):\n“A typical [TEAL] class is comprised of mini lectures scattered throughout the class, separated by periods in which students are engaged in hands-on desktop experiments, visualizations, problem solving, and peer discussion.”\nUnfortunately, despite the fact that TEAL got extremely good results in an experimental trial, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t look like any TEAL-related content has been published in the last 10 years, so it\u0026rsquo;s hard for me to assess its current use. At least, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have completely revolutionized how classes are taught at MIT.\nTechniques Having established that we would like math education to be a lot better and that there\u0026rsquo;s probably a lot of low-hanging fruit given that no one seems to have taken it seriously in recent history (I\u0026rsquo;ve previously written a little bit about aristocratic tutoring), the natural question is, how can we do better? Fortunately, there\u0026rsquo;s lots of research on this that has mostly been ignored. Here are a few techniques which empirically improve student performance:\nActive learning: students are actively engaged in the knowledge they are expected to learn (eg by frequent practice problems) Direct instruction: students learn directly from a knowledgeable source, rather than performing \u0026ldquo;discovery learning\u0026rdquo; where they piece together knowledge for themselves. Discovery learning is one of several techniques which displays an inversion effect: experts benefit from it, but beginners do not. Deliberate practice: students intentionally practice to improve skills at the edge of their ability. Think of a musician practicing the hardest part of a piece over and over again. Mastery learning: students must demonstrate a thorough grasp of the current unit before proceeding to the next one. Scaffolding and automaticity: students are presented with knowledge at a level of granularity which is designed to allow them to make progress as quickly as possible without overloading their working memory. In the same way that it\u0026rsquo;s very hard to read for comprehension if you need to sound out every word, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to grasp new math skills without having adequately practiced all prerequisites Layering: topics build on one another, allowing students to make numerous connections between them Non-interference: counterintuitively, it\u0026rsquo;s usually better not to present closely related material at the same time, because the related pieces of material will interfere with each other and get mixed up. So it\u0026rsquo;s better to space out closely related topics, which is the opposite of what traditional math classes do Spaced repetition and interleaving: you probably already know about this, it involves asking students to recall material at intervals which are designed to create a slight level of difficulty in recollection. This slight difficulty cements the material into place better than even spacing. Similarly, interleaving creates a \u0026lsquo;desireable difficulty\u0026rsquo; by spreading a practice session across a number of skills, as opposed to block practice in which a single skill is practiced over and over. The \u0026ldquo;testing effect\u0026rdquo; is a specific implementation of spaced repetition and interleaving in which students get frequent tests, which forces them to recall a variety of material unaided The Math Academy book goes into a lot of detail about the research supporting these techniques and why they think they are underutilized. Thinking of higher education, an industry dominated by private institutions which, at first glance, you might imagine are incentivized to provide a high-quality education, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty incredible to see students passively sitting in lecture halls absorbing material that they won\u0026rsquo;t have to recall until the final exam. It\u0026rsquo;s about as close to the opposite of high-quality education as it\u0026rsquo;s possible to get.\nSide note: you can get closer to the opposite of this list, by doing unschooling! I\u0026rsquo;d like to say that unschooling really appeals to me on a number of levels, and unschooling advocates would probably have a lot of questions about the methodology of studies that show improvements for these techniques - maybe improved test performance isn\u0026rsquo;t everything. But I\u0026rsquo;m increasingly convinced by the interpretation of unschooling that I introduced at the beginning of this post: probably most of the benefits are a combination of one-on-one tutoring with appropriate attention to the child\u0026rsquo;s emotional state\nMath Academy The book is Math Academy marketing material, and it worked on me! I feel pretty confident in my knowledge of all the math they currently teach, but will be signing up for abstract algebra once it\u0026rsquo;s up. The secret sauce of Math Academy is a manually constructed knowledge graph that covers all of math up through calculus. This graph has typed edges, so there are some edges representing:\nPrerequisites: you must know how to add two-digit numbers before you can multiply two-digit numbers Key prerequisites for specific problems: if you just computed $4^3$ correctly but got $(-4)^3$ wrong, this second problem has \u0026ldquo;multiplying negative numbers\u0026rdquo; as a key prerequisite and triggers a review Encompassings: multiplying a two-digit number by a one-digit number always requires you to multiply a one-digit number by a one-digit number. If you practice the former, you have also practiced the latter, and this allows Math Academy to efficiently serve you your spaced repetition problems without overwhelming you This seems like an extremely cool approach to me, and I believe that they can get fantastic results from it. They also have an XP system that\u0026rsquo;s supposed to gamify the experience a bit and presumably make it easier to set goals. I really can\u0026rsquo;t wait to try out the system for myself!\nEarlier Wordcells vs Better Shape Rotators Math Academy is mostly for kids, and mostly marketed towards parents. Speaking as a non-parent, it seems like it would be important as a parent to carefully decide how you\u0026rsquo;re going to allocate your time, energy, and money. In this sense, Math Academy directly competes with Mentava in the space of \u0026rsquo;things you could spend both money and interpersonal capital forcing your child to do.\u0026rsquo; I think Mentava is an extremely cool project with lots of value to offer the world, but I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I would force my child to do it, whereas I do think I will force my child to do Math Academy. The main reason for this is that I think getting your child to read earlier isn\u0026rsquo;t particularly important.\nPart of the reason for this is that I think it\u0026rsquo;s extremely realistic for kids to master reading early enough in a standard public education that they don\u0026rsquo;t lose out on very much. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t reading for fun until 3rd grade, that\u0026rsquo;s fine! Most people, including early readers, aren\u0026rsquo;t going to be reading challenging books until their teens anyway, and challenging books contain 90% of the value it\u0026rsquo;s possible to get from reading. 85% of native-born Americans are literate, and I suspect almost all of them could read at least some \u0026ldquo;classic literature\u0026rdquo; if they wanted to (think Hemmingway). Only a very small percentage of people ever master math through calculus in a comparable way (such that the basic operations feel effortless and the symbolic manipulation is a transparent representation of the underlying concept, such that they can understand important works in the field). Some of this is probably that math is more difficult than reading, and some of it is probably that math education has more room for improvement. At the end of the day, I think it\u0026rsquo;s likely that Math Academy will produce better mathematicians, whereas it seems like Mentava will produce earlier readers (but not necessarily better-read or more educated people).\nI reached out to Niels Hoven on Twitter to see if he was aware of any evidence that learning to read early produced better outcomes for children. He said that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t aware of any and suspected that any correlation was probably not causal, so I asked him about the argument for using Mentava. I thought that maybe they were planning to build a larger suite of courses for comprehensive acceleration of early childhood education and reading was a prerequisite. But according to Niels, \u0026ldquo;the argument is just that helping children learn quickly is good. If someone doesn\u0026rsquo;t believe that without evidence they\u0026rsquo;re likely not our target demographic.\u0026rdquo; I think this is consistent with my comments above: like Math Academy, Mentava solves a real problem in education with a solution that teaches children much more efficiently than public school (I\u0026rsquo;m not aware of formal experiments supporting this, but purely based on priors I would bet on \u0026ldquo;app I heard about on Twitter\u0026rdquo; over public school). The problem Mentava solves happens to be a much smaller one, as measured by real-world impact, than the problem Math Academy is solving, but I think they\u0026rsquo;re both great examples of how much you can improve education if you take it seriously and I really appreciate Niels taking some time to answer my questions about it. Thank you, Niels!\nClosing Thoughts The Math Academy doc was, for me, the final nail in the coffin of unschooling. I still think that children benefit from substantially more autonomy than they typically get and that they can learn a lot of stuff in a self-directed manner, especially if the self-directed time is interspersed with challenges in a sort of Socratic style (I think history, especially, can benefit from a structure like this: you can just ask your kids to go research the answer to a question, and when they come back it\u0026rsquo;s almost always easy to challenge their answer and give them another avenue of exploration). I believe that giving a child opportunities to exercise autonomy early will help them develop into a curious, disciplined, connected adult. But it\u0026rsquo;s also clear that you can choose a few areas that you care about to practice diligently and effectively and produce outcomes way beyond anything a child would be able accomplish on their own. I think math should be one of those things, and Math Academy seems like they offer a great product for people looking for a one-stop solution to learn it.\nYou can find more information on Math Academy here.\n"

                "section": "thoughts",
                "date" : "2024.10.19",
                "body": "Recoding America, by Jennifer Pahlka\nMy job involves delivering advanced software to government sponsors, but if you had asked me what I thought of the government\u0026rsquo;s ability to deploy technology at scale to solve national problems, I would have thought of healthcare.gov, or any of the numerous recent embarrassing congressional hearings in which policymakers reveal that they apparently learned all they know about the internet five minutes ago from a lovely elderly woman named Ruth, whose primary qualification is that her grandson showed her how to set up the email app on her phone last weekend. I would have told you that the government is radically underinvesting in technology and that they should be leaving technical problems to technical contractors, because they are clearly not able to build something as simple as a website properly. I would have told you that, before I read Recoding America.\nInvestment in Technology Jennifer Pahlka worked for more than a decade in various organizations dedicated to improving government\u0026rsquo;s ability to use technology, and in this book she shares her perspectives on the real problems and solutions in this area. I think maybe my favorite thing about the book was that it made me realize how vague my previous criticisms were. What does it mean to \u0026lsquo;radically underinvest in technology?\u0026rsquo; If Congress had passed a bill promising to spend an additional billion dollars on technology, would I have been happy about that? One of Pahlka\u0026rsquo;s first points is that just spending more money is not enough; the current process of acquiring software and even of deciding what software to acquire is dramatically broken. In fact, one point she notes is that having a big budget up front is harmful to a project, because it will attract more stakeholders with conflicting agendas. Get enough stakeholders on a project up front and it becomes a black hole of money and effort - it will never produce anything useful because the highest levels of the organization will actively oppose useful software if it is not useful to them specifically.\nOne reason for this is that people who go into government are not in it for money. Some are selfless public servants, some just want a steady job - and the rest want power. Power, in Washington, resides in policy making, not in implementation, so building things, and particularly building software, is low-status. Because it is culturally and socially low-status, it is also organizationally low-status; software teams are managed in a command-style approach where directions on what to build flow from the top down, but requests for clarification or good requirements cannot flow from the bottom up. This is a huge problem because requirements are often extremely vague, sometimes self-contradictory, and it\u0026rsquo;s not clear what a final product that meets the requirements would even look like, much less what you can and can\u0026rsquo;t do to build it.\nGovernment Tech is Harder At the same time, technical systems in government have metastasized to a point that would make a grizzled AWS veteran cry. New systems, Pahlka says, often have to be pitched as adding some key functionality rather than as replacements or phase-outs of existing systems. The result is that government databases are sort of like the C++ specification, except worse because they are also databases. In the same way that C++ is actually 85 different programming languages, each with a distinct way of managing memory, government \u0026ldquo;databases\u0026rdquo; are a Lovecraftian assemblage of dozens of underlying databases, managed under different jurisdictions and with different schemas, heroically maintained and occasionally even kept in sync by a 300-page Turing-complete Excel macro written by an extremely grumpy lady named Madge, who under different circumstances would have won a Turing award but who now can never be allowed to retire from her government spreadsheet job. I am joking, but here\u0026rsquo;s a real quote from the book: \u0026ldquo;The architecture diagram for just one benefit center at the VA was so complex that it was displayed on a wall twenty feet long and eight feet tall. Even at that size, many of the elements were printed in a font so small you had to be right up next to the wall to read them\u0026hellip; We think that the technology that runs our government has been designed\u0026hellip; In fact, it has merely accreted.\u0026rdquo;\nPahlka goes on to describe unemployment insurance employees working for the state of California who are considered beginners at operating their system because they have only spent 17 years learning the thousands of macros and dozens of databases involved in its operation. In a genuine attempt to remedy this problem, the state added two more databases. When COVID hit, the state again tried to help - by hiring hundreds of additional workers, none of whom could possibly be of any help because there is no system like this one anywhere else in the world, but who did slow down the work of the existing employees by asking them for help. Refusing these new employees, of course, was not an option.\nLeave Technical Problems to Technical Contractors So now we get to the second point I would have made before reading this book: what exactly does it mean to \u0026rsquo;leave technical problems to technical contractors?\u0026rsquo; Can you just ask Google to build the IRS a new website and walk away? Obviously not - Google doesn\u0026rsquo;t have access to all the information it would need to build something like that. But the other problem is that you have to actually implement the law. As Pahlka notes, the tax code changed an average of once a day between 2001 and 2012, and it is more than 70,000 pages when printed out. This is the plain English version - operationalizing it and writing it as code would be absurdly difficult, and difficult in a way that is completely uninteresting to the kind of person who works at Google.\nBullshit There are lots of cases where you can save someone time by not asking them questions that don\u0026rsquo;t apply to them (for example, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to ask questions about their children on their tax forms if they don\u0026rsquo;t have kids). But the government chooses not to do that because it\u0026rsquo;s not equitable, in that people who fill out the paper versions of a form will have to deal with pointless bullshit, which means that everyone else must also deal with pointless bullshit.\nThere are a number of other frustrating stories in the book: one where the government requires translated versions of a website to be completed in the first iteration, slowing things down for no reason, for no reason other than that they are upset and want to punish the tech people. In another instance, the author tells an official that the $600 million project she is about to bid out is likely to fail. The official responds, \u0026ldquo;Do you think we don\u0026rsquo;t know that? The last seven IT projects in this state have all failed.\u0026rdquo; Another time, an official at the VA tells the author that the database she offered to fix no longer has a latency problem (VA workers who had to interact with this database had time to get coffee while waiting for the next page of someone\u0026rsquo;s file to load). The author eventually finds out that he \u0026ldquo;fixed\u0026rdquo; the latency problem by ordering his subordinates not to report latency problems. Another time, the author successfully deploys a new system which makes applying for benefits at the VA much easier. Applications increase by a factor of 10. This creates a backlog at the VA, which looks bad, so they revert the changes to make it harder to apply again. One contractor describes how he deals with a pointless government requirement that a particular outdated technology be used in all projects: he adds a box to the system diagram in PowerPoint that says \u0026ldquo;ESB\u0026rdquo; on it, and everyone is happy.\nFixes Pahlka\u0026rsquo;s main recommendation is that the government needs to adopt an agile development approach. This would be more revolutionary than it sounds, because it would involve completely changing the acquisition process for software, and might ultimately require the government to develop internal software development capabilities. The reason for this is that the current acquisitions process is to put every requirement you can think of in an RFP and bid it out. There are two results: first, no one who is good at software development even submits a bid, because they know that you can\u0026rsquo;t develop good software that way, and good software developers aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in developing bad software. Second, whoever does win the bid is required to deliver whatever they contracted to deliver, which is generally either a bad idea or impossible. But if your software team can be in dialogue with whatever agency they\u0026rsquo;re working for, and negotiate requirements and explain why they want to take certain approaches, you can get much better software.\nBut sometimes you can\u0026rsquo;t put out an RFP for \u0026ldquo;an actually good product that will deliver on the following high-level objectives\u0026rdquo; because that\u0026rsquo;s not an acceptable form of corruption. So instead you have no option but to develop the software in-house, which allows you to avoid the contract entirely. This also means that your development team gets better at making working software in government each time they solve a problem, instead of basically paying to educate contractors.\nRedemption Arc A few months ago, I renewed my passport. A friend had warned me of a tedious, months-long process that involved mailing my existing passport to Pennsylvania, but I was able to renew online. The website was modern and the experience was fairly streamlined. There were a few minor irritations (the website says that applications open at \u0026ldquo;around midday ET\u0026rdquo;, which actually means exactly 1 PM ET), but otherwise I was extremely pleasantly surprised. Most importantly, I got my passport within a week of ordering it. Also, the IRS finally released online tax filing on their website.\n"

                "body": "Simple body measurements probably work about as well as a bioimpedance scale to inform health decisions and have better-characterized performance\nBioimpedance Scales and How They Work Sometimes when I\u0026rsquo;m working out and trying to lose weight, a thought will occur to me: what if I\u0026rsquo;m actually doing much better at losing fat than the scale claims? What if my weight stubbornly refuses to go down not because losing weight is a slow and difficult process demanding tremendous consistency and a personalized approach but because I am an ALPHA MALE putting on EXTREME MUSCLE? This thought is so appealing that it will quickly be followed with something like, \u0026ldquo;you know, I should REALLY be measuring body fat percentage, not weight.\u0026rdquo; And then the inevitable: \u0026ldquo;I should get one of those bioimpedance scales!\u0026rdquo;\nA bioimpedance scale works by sending an electrical current (an AC current) through your body to measure the impedance (resistance) of your body. Muscle tends to have a lot more electrolytes and ionic solutions than fat, so muscle tissue will conduct electricity better. Your overall body conductivity will depend on a number of factors, including but very much not limited to:\nLean mass/muscle mass Fat mass Bone density Inter- and intra-cellular water content You might notice that if you only have one measure (impedance), this problem is inherently underspecified. The most common approach to this problem is to combine the bioimpedance monitor with a scale and an app that asks users for their height and age, so you can cheat by using variables other than impedance. Some fancy scales will also use multi-frequency bioimpedance, changing the frequency of the AC current and measuring the impedance at different frequencies. The advantage of this is that low-frequency AC is effectively blocked by cell membranes (the membrane acts as a capacitor, and at low frequencies the current is blocked by the membrane most of the time), but high-frequency current is not. This allows you to distinguish between extracellular water content (measured by low-frequency AC) and total water content (high-frequency AC). This allows you to infer intracellular water content. Fat has low intracellular water, while muscle has high intracellular water, so you can infer (modulo overall hydration levels!) the percentage of the body that\u0026rsquo;s bone vs muscle, especially if you can also factor in things like weight and height. But only very fancy scales have this functionality!\nI did not do enough research to figure this out before buying a $20 bioimpedance scale on Amazon.\nDigression: Skinfold Calipers You can use a skinfold technique to measure subcutaneous fat and then infer body composition with some formulas. However, performing this test accurately requires you to have an expert check multiple sites (usually at least the triceps, the \u0026ldquo;subscapular region\u0026rdquo; on your back, and the back of the calf, but sometimes up to seven sites) with the calipers. This technique has fairly high test-retest variability even for skilled practitioners (especially if they\u0026rsquo;re not doing as many sites), so even though it\u0026rsquo;s quite accurate, it\u0026rsquo;s not always very precise, and it will be less accurate and precise for you than it is for people with training. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it makes sense for normal people to use skinfold calipers.\nWe Have Body Composition at Home You can find a huge number of calculators online that will tell you what your body composition is from simple measurements that require no special equipment. But few of these calculators will tell you the margin of error in their outputs. I downloaded the 2005-2006 NHANES demographic and body measurement data and used it to check out a few techniques.\nInferring Body Composition in NHANES A quick caveat: I filtered the NHANES data down to 20-40 year old men to do all of the calculations below. Coefficients typically change across age groups and genders.\nNHANES doesn\u0026rsquo;t include body composition directly, but does include skinfold measurements. I used the regression coefficients on page 10 of \u0026ldquo;Body fat assessed from total body density and its estimation from skinfold thickness: measurements on 481 men and women aged from 16 to 72 years\u0026rdquo; to estimate body density from the tricep and subscapular measurements:\n$$D = 1.1525 - 0.0687 \\log (F_{tri} + F_{sub})$$\nBody density can be converted to percent body fat by means of the Siri equation:\n$$\\texttt{% fat} = 100 * \\left(\\dfrac{4.95}{D} - 4.5\\right)$$\nRelative Fat Mass and Height-Waist Ratio Height-Waist Ratio (HWR) is supposed to be a reasonable proxy for body composition. It is converted to body fat percent with the Relative Fat Mass (RFM) formula:\nFor men:\n$$RFM = 64 - (20 \\times \\frac{\\text{Height}}{\\text{Waist circumference}})$$\nFor women:\n$$RFM = 76 - (20 \\times \\frac{\\text{Height}}{\\text{Waist circumference}})$$\nWhere waist circumference is measured at the top of the iliac crest. Based on the NHANES data, there is a linear relationship between these variables, with an R-squared of 10.90\nBMI BMI is often criticized as an imperfect measure that doesn\u0026rsquo;t account for different body types. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how it stacks up to HWR! I included age in the regression because I found a random website that gave a BMI-Body Fat conversion that included an age term, but in my regression age had a coefficient of 0.04, so basically no effect. The R-squared of this model was 11.35.\nModel: rfm = 0.04 age + 0.96 bmi + -6.07 BMI-HWR OK let\u0026rsquo;s just throw everything into a regression now. Age still had a near-zero coefficient (0.02 this time), so I removed it and just did a BMI-HWR regression. This has an R-squared of 9.99:\nModel: y = 0.462 bmi + -9.512 hwr + 26.707 Using both BMI and HWR gives a larger improvement in $R^2$ over HWR than switching from BMI to HWR! I think it would be really interesting to look at more complex models here - my intuition for why this would be an improvement over HWR is that some people store fat in places that aren\u0026rsquo;t their waist, but this seems like it would suit itself well to some ensemble model. At some point I may try this as an exploration of the Akaike Information Criterion?\nError In this model, 50% of cases have absolute error of less than 2 percentage points body fat percent, and 75% have error \u0026lt;3.2 percentage points. And not only that, but it seems extremely likely to be a good directional indicator (if body fat percent as imputed by this formula goes down, you probably really are losing body fat, not just putting on muscle)\nConclusion I\u0026rsquo;ve been pretty convinced by this exploration that bioimpedance scales don\u0026rsquo;t offer very much marginal accuracy over simpler measurements, with the possible exception of the fancy multifrequency ones. A probable error of 3pp is, in one sense, not great in that it\u0026rsquo;s ~13% of the 5%-30% range of body fat percentage that\u0026rsquo;s interesting to me, but it\u0026rsquo;s dirt-cheap to gather and directionally useful. And it\u0026rsquo;s being compared to a system whose performance characteristics are completely unknown to me. I recommend that you do not buy a bioimpedance scale (and if you really want one - get a multifrequency option).\n"

                "body": "Things I wish I\u0026rsquo;d known about buying a new car\nI recently got a new car! On the whole, I\u0026rsquo;m absolutely delighted with it, but there are some tips I wish I\u0026rsquo;d read about the car buying process which I\u0026rsquo;d like to briefly share.\nAs you research cars, remember that a certain model might make for a good new car but a bad used car, or vice versa! As an example, I got a 2024 Subaru Forester. The Forester has been a fairly unreliable car for a long time, but Subaru started to figure out reliability in 2022. Most used Foresters are a bad deal as they depreciate unusually quickly, but the new ones are quite good! Conversely, the Toyota RAV4 has been a good car for a long time, but the 2024 model is significantly worse. A used RAV4 might be a good deal; a new one is not. Moving on to negotiation: Owning a dealership is one of the most common ways to be a multi-millionaire (or, more precisely, a top 0.1% earner) for a good reason. There is massive information asymmetry between you (the buyer) and the dealer. The dealer knows how much they actually paid for the car. They will, of course, conceal this number from you. Sometimes they\u0026rsquo;ll tell you the \u0026ldquo;invoice price,\u0026rdquo; which is what they paid for the car before the rebates they get from the manufacturer, to throw you off (you might more charitably imagine that they\u0026rsquo;re telling you this to give you a sense of their cost structure - you can make your own inferences about the survival rate of such cooperative dealerships, and the implied probability that you\u0026rsquo;re sitting in one of them). At the same time, the dealer knows how much people like you typically end up paying for cars; they can make a very good guess at your reservation value. The best way to approach this situation is to avoid negotiating if possible: If the car you\u0026rsquo;re buying is a high-volume commodity, you can price shop, effectively bypassing the negotiation process. Honda vehicles are great for this because each model has a small number of identical configurations, so cars can be directly compared on price. Contrastingly, most cars come with a stunning variety of configurations, making it quite difficult to find identical vehicles to compare. If you want a car that\u0026rsquo;s harder to price shop, you can still (privately) identify the features that are important to you and find 3-4 acceptable cars at different dealerships near you. Call the first dealer and tell them you don\u0026rsquo;t want to negotiate, just give me your best price. Refuse the offer. Call the next dealer and tell them the same thing. If they give you a worse price, tell them you\u0026rsquo;ve had a better offer and ask them to beat it. Refuse their offer regardless. Call the final dealer (ideally, this one will have the build you want the most) and repeat the process one more time, accepting their offer if it seems reasonable. This process will probably get you a price 90% as good as an excellent negotiator could have gotten, for perhaps 10% of the effort. If you must negotiate, try to get the dealer to make multiple moves by making non-moves. You can just say things like \u0026ldquo;hm, I just really can\u0026rsquo;t afford a price that high\u0026rdquo; without making an actual counteroffer. This is a frustrating thing to do, but you can make it work for you if you play an inexperienced negotiator. Related to the last point: if you must negotiate, don\u0026rsquo;t do so in person. For one thing, in-person negotiation makes it harder for you, the less knowledgeable party, to research statements and offers made by the dealer to know if they are accurate/fair. Additionally, showing up to negotiate in person tells the dealer that you\u0026rsquo;re fairly committed to buying their car, because you\u0026rsquo;ve invested time in coming to negotiate with them. They will mentally make upwards adjustments to their estimate of your reservation value accordingly. Also related: as a very slight over-generalization, all car salesmen will lie to you, especially during the negotiation process. I liked (and still like) my salesmen. They seemed self-consciously honest and straightforward to me, and I\u0026rsquo;d be willing to bet that\u0026rsquo;s how they perceive themselves. But they lied (including lies of omission, strongly implying false statements, and, I think, full-out lies) at least four times that I remember during the negotiation. The negotiation process starts when you walk in the door and ends after you either buy the car or commit to not buying it. To this point, you can express enthusiasm about the car in general, but try to avoid expressing enthusiasm about any nonstandard feature. If a dealer notices you really like nonstandard feature x, they will offer to sell you a version of the car without x for less money while you\u0026rsquo;re negotiating on price. This is a way for the dealer to make a non-move - they know you won\u0026rsquo;t actually accept the offer, but they get to look like they\u0026rsquo;re making an effort to move. Beware false asymptotes. Dealers almost never asymptote their offering price at their actual reservation value. If you have some extra item you might want to put on the table, like a trade-in, one strategy might be to wait until the dealer asymptotes. Leave the dealership, wait a day or two, and then bring up the trade-in. They might become more willing to give you a little extra money for the trade-in as an alternative way of negotiating the price. Try being mildly irrational. It\u0026rsquo;s a tired trick for car salesmen to give you a high price, wait for the inevitable counteroffer, tell you they have to talk to their boss, and then go into the back room and watch TikTok for 5 minutes. Then they come out and say, \u0026ldquo;my boss was really mad at me, but I convinced him to come down to [some marginally lower price].\u0026rdquo; Maybe go into the dealership to negotiate, wait for the salesman to pull this, and then leave while they\u0026rsquo;re gone and refuse to negotiate further in person. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to be rude about this; just tell them you don\u0026rsquo;t appreciate sitting around waiting and you\u0026rsquo;d prefer to negotiate via text from now on. Ideally you tell them this over text after you\u0026rsquo;ve left. Especially if the car dealership is a reasonable distance from your house, this will create the impression that you\u0026rsquo;re an emotional person willing to do irrational things, like walk away from a car that you like even though you\u0026rsquo;ve invested a fair bit of time in buying it already. I imagine this trick works even better if you can get a confederate to play the irrational scapegoat. Then you get to reverse the trick - \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d love to come back in, but Steve is really upset we had to wait around.\u0026rdquo; Based on my research, I\u0026rsquo;m fairly confident I got a very good deal on my car. However, I suspect I could have done even better if I\u0026rsquo;d known these things ahead of time. Hopefully my counterfactual loss is your gain!\n"

                "body": "A low-status take on PUA\nAt first (middle school/early high school), I didn\u0026rsquo;t ask any girls out because I was playing dumb status games and it was easy to make fun of my classmates for their early attempts at romance. As I became obese and developed mental health problems in high school, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine that anyone would want to date me. And the parts of me that told me I was unlovable were validated the first couple of times I did screw up the courage to ask someone out - not only did I get rejected, but I was rejected a couple of times in especially embarrassing ways that stayed with me for a long time (not that I was especially blameless in this, it\u0026rsquo;s just what happened).\nSo - cut to me in early college: lonely, overly analytical, poor social skills (at least around flirting/romance), and, by this point, mildly traumatized and thoroughly scared of rejection. A predictable thing to happen at this point is that I would be attracted by the pickup artist (PUA, which I\u0026rsquo;ll also use for \u0026ldquo;pickup artistry\u0026rdquo;) \u0026ldquo;community\u0026rdquo; (in quotes because it\u0026rsquo;s really more an industry than a community). Fortunately, this did not happen, but it might have, because PUA is marketed squarely at people like me. The book that popularized PUA in modern culture, The Game, was written while I was in elementary school and I\u0026rsquo;ve never read it, but I did read a few reviews to write this and one of my favorite quotes is:\nThe point was women; the result was men. Instead of models in bikinis lounging by the Project Hollywood pool all day, we had pimply teenagers, bespectacled businessmen, tubby students, lonely millionaires, struggling actors, frustrated taxi drivers, and computer programmers—lots of computer programmers\n- Neil Strauss, author of The Game, talking about PUA\nI would have fit right in. But I also noticed a lot of reviews saying things like: \u0026ldquo;I doubt [Strauss] has anything helpful for anyone except those men whose emotional maturity stalled at age 15\u0026rdquo; or describing PUAs as \u0026ldquo;pathetic,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;sinister,\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;puerile.\u0026rdquo; I struggled with a lot of self-hatred for a long time, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to write the thing that I wish I\u0026rsquo;d read back in early college, on pickup artistry and pickup artists - coming from a place of deep love for the person I was.\nAs I try to do that, I\u0026rsquo;ll note that the tremendous contempt reviewers have for The Game comes despite Strauss himself pointing out multiple times that the book is explicitly a commentary on how PUA is ultimately unfulfilling (despite or because of the fact that, at least for Strauss, it was effective in allowing him to sleep with a lot of women). Strauss has since published another book, The Truth, about inner work and relationships, which I\u0026rsquo;m eventually hoping to read. Since I haven\u0026rsquo;t read The Game, I\u0026rsquo;ll withhold judgement on how rational the reviewers are, but I\u0026rsquo;ll say that writing this piece required me to spend a fair bit of time working through an irrational urge to distance myself from PUA as much as I can. To a certain extent, this protected me from getting into PUA and was a good thing, but attacking already suffering people to protect your status isn\u0026rsquo;t how you make the world a better place. And so, without further ado:\nSome PUA-like Thing is Good Imagine a 3D graph showing some scalar-valued function of two variables. On the x axis is your level of social skills (as related to romance - how good you are at flirting, reading signals, etc). On the y axis is how often you hit on people. The z axis shows f(x, y), a function giving the change in how comfortable people are as a result of you hitting on people (alternately: how much utility/value you\u0026rsquo;re adding to the world by hitting on people).\nThe optimal place to be on the curve is not (0,0,0)! More than this, even if f(x, y) did attain its maximum value at (0,0,0), which I don\u0026rsquo;t think it does, helping people to learn social skills efficiently as they hit on people should produce less discomfort overall. Some people are already very efficient at learning social skills, and some are not. I don\u0026rsquo;t think the inefficient people are creepy losers who deserve to die alone.\nTo be very explicit: I think some thing that teaches clueless people when and how and where to flirt, and what other people might be looking for, would be good for the world. That being said\u0026hellip;\nPUA Itself is Not Great Having acknowledged that all PUA-like things, even good ones, will be vulnerable to accusations of creepiness, PUA seems creepier than it has to be. I associate PUA with weird dudes with hats and goatees either aggressively and awkwardly hitting on clearly uninterested girls or, if they\u0026rsquo;re good at it, manipulating girls into having sex as much for the pleasure of exercising power over someone through manipulation as for the sex itself. A big part of the problem here is that PUA, to overgeneralize, seems to be built on the idea that the only way girls would be interested in you is if you somehow tricked them into it.\nThis makes sense when you consider that PUA is an industry, where the most influential people have something (a book, a workshop, a course) they want to sell you. They know that their typical prospective customer has low self-esteem and already specialize in exploiting low self-esteem, so of course they play on your sense of inferiority. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t get corrected because the powerful stigma attached to PUA-like things creates a moat around the community; more \u0026ldquo;moderate\u0026rdquo; versions of PUA aren\u0026rsquo;t worth the reputational cost of promoting them and don\u0026rsquo;t survive.\nAttempts to disclaim this within PUA typically go something like \u0026ldquo;well of course it\u0026rsquo;s all about your personality and stuff, but you need to learn these tricks or you\u0026rsquo;ll get rejected before girls have a chance to see your personality.\u0026rdquo; I think this might be a reasonable point in favor of making some deliberate attempt to learn social skills, but PUA somewhat undercuts itself by (in my reading) going way beyond just stopping you from instantly disqualifying yourself.\nRejection is a scary thing, and I think PUA embodies one of the two approaches I\u0026rsquo;m aware of to getting over your fear of it: going full sociopath, where rejection isn\u0026rsquo;t scary to you because you refuse to let the interaction you\u0026rsquo;re about to have have any kind of impact on you. You never get over your sense of being fundamentally unlovable (in fact, you reinforce that sense every time you trick or manipulate someone into sleeping with you), but maybe you get laid.\nTrying to Imagine a Better Version of This If I\u0026rsquo;m going to write the essay I wish I\u0026rsquo;d read when I was starting college, there has to be some affirmative advice. So what would PUA look like if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t based on the idea of tricking people into sex? First, I think it would still have to acknowledge that certain lifestyles and habits are almost universally more or less attractive (eg: good hygiene). It\u0026rsquo;s perfectly legitimate to decide to change these to be more attractive; it\u0026rsquo;s also perfectly legitimate to decide not to, or to change your mind once you\u0026rsquo;ve decided. In any event, making the decision consciously is useful as a way to clarify and pursue your priorities.\nSecond, it\u0026rsquo;s important to acknowledge that no one wants to make women uncomfortable (and prioritize this in practice!), while also acknowledging that \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make people uncomfortable\u0026rdquo; is a common excuse to avoid discomfort yourself. As a matter of process, this might look like prioritizing inner work while also taking into account that endless inner work with no actual action is an easy failure mode for many people. Getting this right is super important, because \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m making women uncomfortable\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m inherently bad and no one would ever accept me as I am\u0026rdquo; are common, mutually reinforcing stories. Zooming out, some people might generally spend a fair bit of time figuring out what kinds of things they feel ethically OK with doing while also keeping in mind that their desired endpoint on the 3D curve mentioned above is a better world than the one they live in (even if only because they themselves are better off). That said, one thing I think PUA actually does well is pushing people to just approach other people they\u0026rsquo;re interested in. In the age of dating apps, hitting on people in person is a ridiculous advantage. Tinder is currently selling a service that will let you pay $500 a month to message two people a week without first having matched with them. You know what else allows you to hit on someone without competing for a right swipe? Walking up to them and saying hello.\nLastly, I think it would be designed around the fact that 90% of interested people are fundamentally confused about the world in important ways. I\u0026rsquo;m guessing with zero data, but I\u0026rsquo;d bet the PUA breakdown is 90% people with mild mental health issues/poor social skills and 10% psychopaths who love manipulating people and just want some tips. In some ways, PUA in its current form seems to be about converting members of the former group into members of the latter. New PUA would be significantly about inner work and getting comfortable with the feeling of being shot down.\nOutro I met my wonderful girlfriend three years before we started dating. She was seeing someone else, and I had no interest in hitting on someone else\u0026rsquo;s girlfriend. The hilariously ironic thing about our relationship is that, over the time we knew each other, I got more and more confident hitting on other people, but she was the one with the guts to call me and ask if I\u0026rsquo;d noticed that the vibe between us had gotten to be more than just friendly since she broke up with her boyfriend. I am so tremendously glad that she did.\nSo I guess that last advice I\u0026rsquo;d give myself is: don\u0026rsquo;t worry too much. You have absolutely no idea how anything will turn out.\n"

                "body": "Takeaways from Negotiation Genius by Malhotra and Bazerman (2007).\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a deeply unfair thing: people tend to judge you by the same standards they use to judge themselves. Very fashionable people will judge you for having poor style, while frugal people will judge you for having expensive tastes. It\u0026rsquo;s very hard to get everyone to like you, and not typically worth trying. But the people who sell you your house and car, and the people who you\u0026rsquo;ll probably be negotiating your job salary with, are predictably a certain kind of person, and that\u0026rsquo;s the kind of person who has read Negotiation Genius by Deepak Malhotra and Max Bazerman. In fact, they might have taken classes from them. These people often have a lot of latitude to offer you anything from a couple thousand dollars (on your car) to hundreds of thousands over the course of your career (salaries are surprisingly sticky and negotiating a good or bad one can influence your income even if you switch companies or even jobs).\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to briefly zoom in on the salary negotiation aspect, because it\u0026rsquo;s easy to make yourself a lot more money on a negotiation. The HR person you\u0026rsquo;re negotiating with doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to waste their time finding another candidate and they\u0026rsquo;re not even spending their own money when they increase your salary. On the other hand, if you\u0026rsquo;re an engineer, the HR person doesn\u0026rsquo;t know enough engineering to be impressed by your resume. Their only experience of you that they can judge is your ability to negotiate, and if you\u0026rsquo;re bad at it they\u0026rsquo;ll assume you\u0026rsquo;re not valuable in other areas either.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to emphasize here is that negotiation is an attitude towards another person and your relationship with them, not just a set of tricks. I\u0026rsquo;d summarize it as \u0026ldquo;obviously I\u0026rsquo;m going to protect my own interests, including at the expense of your interests, but I also hold goodwill towards you and want us both to be better off for having worked together.\u0026rdquo; If you\u0026rsquo;re successful in holding this attitude (and not clueless at the actual technique of negotiation), you will get the business bro in-group discount, redeemable for probably tens of thousands of dollars over the course of your life. That\u0026rsquo;s the value proposition of Negotiation Genius.\nHaggling vs Negotiation What we think of as negotiation can be broken into two categories: negotiation and haggling. Haggling is what you do with a street vendor in India to determine how much you will pay for an item, and it\u0026rsquo;s mostly characterized by being zero-sum: the product or service being provided is set, and you are attempting to pay the minimum (or extract the maximum) price.\nFrom a game-theoretic point of view, haggling is quite easy to model. For the sake of example, let\u0026rsquo;s say I\u0026rsquo;m trying to buy from that Indian street vendor. Both the vendor and I privately have some reservation value (also known as a break-even value or a walk-away value). I will not pay more than my reservation value; the vendor will not accept less than his. My goal is to pay exactly the vendor\u0026rsquo;s reservation value, while the vendor\u0026rsquo;s goal is to extract exactly mine. Therefore, we play an iterated game called \u0026ldquo;haggling\u0026rdquo; in which we attempt to bluff our true reservation values while finding out as much as we can about the other person\u0026rsquo;s. Or so it goes in theory. In practice, bargaining is often about frame control, with each side trying to deploy or neutralize narrative elements justifying changes in the price.\nHaggling is at most two-dimensional. You can add a dimension by offering to buy more at a lower unit price (I hesitate to even call this a full extra dimension) and in some cultures you can get away with continuing to negotiate on the items being purchased after the price has been set by saying things like \u0026ldquo;OK, I\u0026rsquo;m paying more than I want for these, how about you throw in this too?\u0026rdquo;\nNegotiation is distinct from haggling mostly in that it\u0026rsquo;s higher-dimensional and often done with a durable relationship in mind (haggling tends to be one-off). But this is actually a change in kind, not just in extent! For example, outright lying is often an accepted part of haggling (of course, this varies culturally), but very unwise in negotiation since it might result in a contract being voided, a relationship terminated, and even a reduction in your ability to do business in a market/sector in the future. But maybe the biggest difference between negotiation and haggling is that moves in a negotiation often have the potential to be positive-sum (this is only sometimes true in haggling when you make the move of offering to buy more for a lower unit price).\nNegotiation More Broadly Defined more broadly, negotiation doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be a thing that only happens when two people explicitly agree to start negotiating. The authors tell a story of breaking up a bar fight:\nA few years ago, Deepak was shooting pool at a bar with a friend and two strangers. Suddenly, a group of about eight college students stormed into the room. They threw a pool stick onto the table, disrupting the game, and started to scream and curse. Needless to say, Deepak and his friend were taken aback. The two strangers who were playing with them immediately charged at the leader of the gang of students. In a matter of seconds, the friendly game of eight ball had become a shoving match. A fight was about to break out—and it was not at all clear why.\nTrying to stop the fight, Deepak and his friend wedged themselves between the two main combatants. It soon became obvious that the college students were upset because they believed that, moments earlier, someone at Deepak’s table had disrupted their game in the adjacent room. Deepak knew this was not true, but the accusation only fueled the rage on both sides. Deepak and his friend wanted to clear up the misunderstanding, but the situation was getting more physical by the moment. It would have been quite easy for Deepak and his friend to simply walk away—by now, the fight was entirely between the college students and the two strangers—but that did not seem like the right thing to do.\nOnce it became clear that the provocateurs were unwilling to consider the situation a misunderstanding, Deepak tried a different approach. “Okay,” he said to the leader of the college students. “We understand that you think someone ‘messed with you.’ But what do you think needs to happen now to avoid a fight?”\nThe leader looked at Deepak just long enough to answer. “I don’t know, but you guys messed up our game, so it’s a bit late to apologize,” he said before rejoining the fray.\nDeepak decided to try again: “Okay, but now you’ve messed up our game as well—so aren’t we even?”\n“No, we’re not even,” the student shouted. “You started it!”\n“I see. Well, let’s say someone in this room did start something,” Deepak said. “Can you imagine something that could happen now that would make you prefer not to fight? What would that look like? What would you rather be doing?”\nThe leader was in disbelief, but took a moment to consider the question. “Well, I’d rather be playing pool,” he answered, “but we’re going to have to start a whole new game.”\n“And how much will that cost?” asked Deepak.\n“One dollar,” the student responded.\nDeepak took a dollar bill out of his wallet and handed it to the leader. “How about it? Your next game is on me.”\nThe leader smiled as he slowly reached for the dollar. “You know, that’s very cool,” he said. “That’s really very nice of you.” He spent the next few minutes calming down his friends, and then escorted them out of the room. The fight was avoided, no blood was spilled, and no bones were broken. All it took was one dollar.\nThis is both a very real negotiation and a very interesting way of dealing with conflict in the modern world. Once upon a time, transactions like this were common (see David Graeber\u0026rsquo;s excellent book Debt: The First 5000 Years for some cool examples - some of the most relevant ones come from medieval Ireland, where an incredibly complex legal system established the monetary value of various blows to a person\u0026rsquo;s pride). Negotiations of this sort, where an \u0026ldquo;honor price\u0026rdquo; is established more or less explicitly, have admittedly gone out of fashion, but almost certainly produced surplus value in this case.\nIf I were to try to sum up the \u0026ldquo;negotiator worldview\u0026rdquo; I\u0026rsquo;m circling here, it would be a perspective of constantly looking for opportunities to produce and claim surplus value through cooperation with others.\nNegotiation Tactics Negotiation Genius deals mostly with tactics of negotiation. You won\u0026rsquo;t find much on haggling (which is its own art form) here.\nThe Algorithm Negotiation Genius offers an algorithm to prepare for a negotiation:\nFigure out your BATNA and RV. BATNA is \u0026ldquo;best alternative to a negotiated agreement.\u0026rdquo; RV is reservation value, or the price at which you\u0026rsquo;re indifferent about the deal. Your RV may not be the same as your BATNA if, for example, you think you can actually do better than your current BATNA. Create a scoring system based on all the issues you care about. This is important because some issues may be qualitatively different. If you\u0026rsquo;re negotiating for a job, how important is salary vs bonus vs health benefits vs vacation time vs remote work? You want to be able to systematically trade these things off against each other on the fly during the negotiation. Figure out your opponent\u0026rsquo;s BATNA, try to estimate their RV. Find the ZOPA. ZOPA is \u0026ldquo;zone of possible agreement\u0026rdquo; - it\u0026rsquo;s the region between your RV and your opponent\u0026rsquo;s. The Tactics On whether to make the first offer: the advantage of making the first offer is that it serves as an anchor, which apparently is one of the behavioral econ effects that actually does replicate. The disadvantage is that it reveals your model of your opponent. Because you need to make an offer you can justify, your opponent can always ask you how you arrived at your number. If your research on your opponent\u0026rsquo;s RV was correct, your first offer can keep the entire ZOPA in play while still being justifiable, anchoring your opponent high. If your research was incorrect, you may have just offered your opponent an excellent deal - or an insultingly bad one.\nInvestigative negotiation: one of the key points of this book is that negotiation is all about your opponent. The point of the negotiation for you is to learn as much as you can about what your opponent wants, what their pain points are, and how they\u0026rsquo;re thinking of this deal. You often switch between trying to sound as informed as possible (disincentivizing them from lying to you) and asking genuine questions to try to understand where your opponent is coming from.\nContingency contracts: I love this tactic. Oftentimes, negotiations center around predictions of the future. Will this car be reliable? Will this real estate be used residentially or be rezoned as commercial? What\u0026rsquo;s the probability this new drug will come to market by 2024? Both participants in the negotiation are incentivized to predict in opposite directions in order to claim more of the available value. Contingency contracts free you from the issues of prediction: you just add a clause to your contract specifying that if the drug does make it to market in 2024, then the buyer has to pay more to the seller at that time. If you think your opponent\u0026rsquo;s predictions are much worse than yours, you can make this a huge bet.\nOn closing a deal: this isn\u0026rsquo;t novel, but if you express that you\u0026rsquo;re very happy with a deal to the person you just made it with, they\u0026rsquo;ll realize that they could have done better and paradoxically be unhappy (even though you may have been trying to be polite). Take time to think their excellent offer over.\nLogrolling: Logrolling is a term which generally refers to any quid pro quo, but is used in the book to refer to a positive-sum move in a negotiation in which each side makes concessions in areas which are relatively less important to them than they are to their opponent. For instance, if I can only manufacture 100k components per year and have no desire to expand, and you want to buy all of the components I can make, having an exclusive contract doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter much to me - but it may matter a great deal to you. So we can agree to a higher unit cost (important to me) in exchange for an exclusive contract (important to you).\nOn negotiating multiple issues: there\u0026rsquo;s a temptation to reduce cognitive load by discussing issues one at a time, and to set aside certain issues as irrelevant to the current negotiation/contract. Every time you do either of these things, you reduce your opportunities for logrolling.\nNegotiating with friends and family: oftentimes, we are tempted to compromise on every issue when we negotiate with our friends and family, because this protects our reputation as selfless and decent people. But compromising on every issue eliminates opportunities to create value through logrolling! You can have more satisfying relationships by more explicitly trading off based on priorities.\nPost-settlement settlements (PSS): sometimes you can create value by first signing a deal, then proposing to your opponent that you try to create additional value through modifications to the deal. This can work for a number of reasons: it may be easier to reveal certain information now that there\u0026rsquo;s a signed contract in place, and both parties can be more confident that their goals are aligned during the PSS than they were during the initial negotiation\nDon\u0026rsquo;t assume, notice that you are confused: sometimes a party will believe that they can only protect a certain interest by insisting on a particular demand. This will often lead them to act against their interests! If I can only manufacture 100k components a year, and you want to pay me a little more in exchange for an exclusivity clause, and I reject the clause categorically, you should be confused. You might assume that I want to expand my business and sell to your competitor later, but I might have an agreement with my brother to sell him 50 components a year for his lawn mower repair business. I\u0026rsquo;d agree to a slightly modified exclusivity agreement that provided for a small number of components I could sell to my brother.\nFailing a negotiation: a negotiation fails when you can\u0026rsquo;t reach an agreement. Since you presumably entered the negotiation imagining that you could reach an agreement, a negotiation should never end with a \u0026ldquo;no.\u0026rdquo; You should always either get a yes or an explanation as to why not.\nSharing information: in order to logroll successfully, you need to share information about the ordinal relative importance of various issues (\u0026ldquo;x is more important to me than y\u0026rdquo;). But you should avoid sharing information about the absolute importance of those issues, and maybe even the extent of relative importance. If you reveal that an issue is actually unimportant to you, your opponent will learn that they can claim value on that issue without conceding very much in exchange.\nDisaggregate their gains, aggregate their losses: people are more likely to be satisfied with a concession broken into several smaller concessions, and will likely be less dissatisfied if you make a comprehensive concession demand rather than several smaller ones.\nDoor in the face, foot in the door: if you need to make a demand seem reasonable, you might make a fairly large demand, then back off towards what you actually want (door in the face). If you want people to feel committed to your program of action, you can make a relatively small request, then escalate your ask days or weeks later (foot in the door).\nRefuse to reveal your RV: sometimes, people who either don\u0026rsquo;t know much about negotiation or think you don\u0026rsquo;t know much about negotiation will just ask you your reservation value. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the lowest price you will accept for this?\u0026rdquo;\nSince flat-out refusing to answer can be a bit awkward (though totally reasonable!), the authors suggest you respond with a joke: \u0026ldquo;I think you already know the answer—it happens to be the most you are willing to pay for it!\u0026rdquo;\nOvercoming a weak position: if you think you have a weak BATNA, first try not to reveal this. One strategy is, if possible, to keep focus on your opponent\u0026rsquo;s BATNA - they may make the mistake of not realizing that your position is even worse. Failing this, make ethical attempts to make your position look good. For instance, if you only have one job offer, you can emphasize that you have other interviews coming up, or that you only just sent out a dozen applications and expect to hear back soon. If you\u0026rsquo;re in a position where the thing you\u0026rsquo;re selling is a commodity, try to find a way to break out of that position by focusing on your distinct value proposition (DVP). Finally, in smaller negotiations you can always simply ask the other party to help you out. This can work surprisingly well in situations like job negotiations, where the long-term relationship is very important relative to the amounts of money involved.\nConsider your entire negotiation portfolio: consider a situation like this: my widget company now faces competition from cheap Chinese widgets, which are being sold at a lower price. If I match the Chinese price, I will lose half of my profits, but still make money. In any particular negotiation, then, it makes sense for me to match their price. But what if I discover that I only stand to lose about 25% of my customers by not matching? I can actually make more money by simply allowing some of my negotiations to fail!\nWhen not to negotiate: negotiation is sometimes inappropriate because there are things that cannot be negotiated. Social status, loyalty, and in-group belonging cannot be negotiated. Actual adherence to the terms or spirit of an agreement cannot be negotiated. This means that a negotiation in which one party is asymmetrically more powerful are unlikely to be respected later, unless that party also has the means of coercion. Also, there are times when negotiation is impossible. When either party has nothing to offer, there can be no negotiation.\nBusiness majors dumb lol Consider the following scenario:\nTwo companies, A and B, are the leading players in their industry. Company C, which falls in the next tier in the same industry, is worth $1 billion as a stand-alone company, and its management has announced that it would be interested in being acquired at a favorable price. Analysts have identified A and B as the obvious bidders, since the acquisition of C by either A or B would make either company the dominant player in the industry. Both A and B have analyzed the possible acquisition of C and both have concluded that C would be worth $1.2 billion if managed by A or B. This means that if A or B could acquire C for under $1.2 billion, it would be a profitable acquisition, but anything above $1.2 billion would create a net loss and would lead to a drop in the acquirer’s stock price. However, if A were to acquire C, B would be at a catastrophic disadvantage and would lose $0.5 billion. Similarly, if B were to acquire C, A would also lose $0.5 billion. Finally, if either A or B makes an offer for C, the other company will learn of the offer. So, as the CEO of Company A, what should you do? Specifically, your response should be formatted as a bid on Company C, between $0 (equivalent to no offer) and $1.7M.\nYou, as someone who likely is not an MBA but who possibly has heard of a dollar auction, might notice that the equilibrium solution here is that one company loses $0.5 billion on an acquisition of company C and the other company loses $0.5 billion in market share. Once the bidding process is initiated, each player will try to save themselves money by making a slightly higher bid until this equilibrium is reached. So the solution is to not initiate the bidding process.\nBut when they were given the opportunity to play this scenario as an iterated game (getting to see how their bids played out after each trial), and replaying the game 20 times, \u0026ldquo;only five out of seventy-two participants from a leading MBA program learned to make a bid of zero over the course of the trials. In more recent research, these errors were shown to persist even after one hundred trials.\u0026rdquo;\nOverall I quite liked this book! I was considering a few others that seemed to be much more psychological, and while those might be valuable too I\u0026rsquo;m glad I didn\u0026rsquo;t go with them. The book has lots of high quality examples taken from the real world, and does a good job of both motivating its lessons concretely while also contextualizing them in economic theory. It also does a good job of highlighting the odd push and pull of being cooperative enough to logroll and reveal information to the other party that will allow them to give you what you want while also being adversarial enough to maintain and exploit information asymmetries so as to position yourself favorably within the ZOPA. If you\u0026rsquo;re too cooperative, your opponent will capture your profits, but if you\u0026rsquo;re too adversarial you\u0026rsquo;ll miss opportunities to create mutual value.\nIf I could have added something, I would have gone for a section with tips for negotiating with friends and family. The authors point out that such negotiations are often systematically suboptimal due to perverse incentives, but the book doesn\u0026rsquo;t put much focus on the sort of informal negotiations people engage in on a day-to-day basis, so we aren\u0026rsquo;t left with any strategies to improve on them.\nMy least favorite chapter was the one on implicit bias. It seems to have been included purely to signal the political alignment of the authors, as they were apparently unable to find a single instance where they\u0026rsquo;re willing to even suggest that implicit bias may have affected a negotiation (the book is otherwise very good at giving examples). And there\u0026rsquo;s a good reason for this: science generally has been unable to find examples of implicit bias producing real-world outcomes. A plausible explanation for this is that implicit bias is really something more like a learned concept pairing. We often see certain concepts paired in the world, and we learn those pairings regardless of our attitude towards them. For instance, if a die-hard Trump fan took an IAT for the word \u0026ldquo;fascist\u0026rdquo; and various presidential candidates, I would expect them to match \u0026ldquo;fascist\u0026rdquo; to Trump faster and \u0026lsquo;display an implicit anti-Trump bias\u0026rsquo; - even though they are in real life unreasonably biased towards Trump - because \u0026ldquo;fascist\u0026rdquo; is an insult reserved for the left to use against the right, just like \u0026ldquo;snowflake\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;libtard\u0026rdquo; are reserved for the right to use against the left. So I skimmed most of the chapter, no big loss. I\u0026rsquo;ll also note in the interest of fairness that this book was written in 2007 and a lot of the challenges to implicit bias have arisen in the last 4-5 years (I think).\n"

But both of these books have been valuable to me in changing how I think, so I\u0026rsquo;d like to review both of them here.\nBut before I do, I\u0026rsquo;d like to caveat the usefulness of this review: some books are useful primarily for the information they contain, and these books are the ones for which a summary or review is most helpful. You may not need to know the book\u0026rsquo;s subject at a tremendous level of detail; a review can offer a lower-resolution view of the same thing. But books of information are a recent invention: for most of their history, books have been considered primarily useful for the experience of reading the book, and books of this sort are very much still in existence. For books of this sort, the \u0026ldquo;information\u0026rdquo; in the book isn\u0026rsquo;t adequately modeled as an abstract information entity amenable to various encodings, transformations, etc. without changes to the underlying value. Both of the books I\u0026rsquo;m reviewing here are books of this sort; you will gain a good deal from reading them even if you already know more or less what they have to say.\nListen, by Patty Wipfler Patty Wipfler founded Hand in Hand Parenting, an organization designed to promote and support certain attitudes and techniques in parenting (and discourage others). In Listen, she enumerates 5 parenting techniques with goofy names, and sketches a fairly radical parenting philosophy. The essence of the philosophy is that childrens\u0026rsquo; emotional breakdowns are a good thing, and virtually all other misbehavior is a way for children to signal their parents that they need a safe environment to break down. Here\u0026rsquo;s an anecdote, selected for representativeness, from Wipfler\u0026rsquo;s book, which contains more than 100 such stories:\nOne of the children who had graduated from the infant-toddler center I directed couldn’t go to sleep by herself. She needed either her mom or her dad to lie down with her, and it often took her a long time to finally fall asleep. The lack of sleep and long bedtime routine was affecting the parents’ relationship with one another, so they decided to help her face her fears. They asked my advice about how to help wean her from their presence after some snuggles at bedtime. I suggested that they tell their daughter they’d help her until she felt safe in her bed alone, and then initiate small steps of separation to let her feel fears while they listened and supported her.\nThey talked with their three-year-old about this project, expecting it to take many nights. And Rebecca began to cry that night, worried about how she would feel when her mommy and daddy left the room. They listened to her, reassured her that they would be nearby, and told her she would be safe in her bed. They snuggled with her for about ten minutes, and then made the move to sit up. She began to cry, so they sat on the bed, listening to her cry and letting her reach for them. She would reach and cry, hold on and cry, and when her crying subsided, they would peel her clutching arms away slightly to help her feel the prospect of separation again. Slowly, over a period of two hours in her room, they moved inch by inch away from her. She cried, sweated, and trembled, but they kept reassuring Rebecca that all was well. They said that they would watch over her from a distance, keeping her safe. By the time she fell asleep, they were listening to her from across the room, near her doorjamb, but they had not left the room. They’d kept eye contact with her the whole time.\nThey were both relieved and worried when she finally slept. She had cried so long! Would she be less trusting of them in the morning? What if they had made a terrible mistake? But Rebecca awoke feeling energetic, warmly connected, and eager to go to preschool. Her parents didn’t see the sad, distant child that they had imagined the night before. Rebecca said goodbye easily at preschool, and seemed happy to be there. At the end of the day, her teacher told her mom, “She’s been shy since she arrived here, always hovering around the edge of play. But today, she jumped right in, laughed, entered games that included several children, and had a great time. We’ve never seen her like this before!”\nHer parents were amazed and relieved. The work Rebecca had done the night before had not only made a huge difference in her day, but that night, she went to sleep contentedly after a snuggle and a story.\nOne of the big points of this story is that Rebecca needed to cry about something. We don\u0026rsquo;t know what she needed to cry about, and don\u0026rsquo;t need to know. Rebecca likely doesn\u0026rsquo;t know herself. She doesn\u0026rsquo;t know how she\u0026rsquo;s feeling. All Rebecca and her parents can know is that she needs to cry. The essence of Listen, as I understand it, is giving your children the warmth and connection they need to work through their issues by crying, having tantrums, etc., with your engaged support. This also sometimes means giving your child the excuse they need to break down. Rebecca\u0026rsquo;s parents intentionally set up a situation where she would cry, and when she stopped crying they adjusted their behavior to give her another opportunity for discomfort. Rebecca benefited from the opportunity to fully work through her emotions, not only in the resolution of the immediate challenge of going to sleep by herself, but also in apparently unrelated areas of her life.\nWipfler offers five or so tools to help you work through parenting problems.\nPlaylistening is one of the two play-based ways to interact with children, and it\u0026rsquo;s done informally as a way to release tension. This can help kids stay on track after being instructed and managed all day - or even serve as a way of adjusting behavior in a more playful way, without typical instruction and management. You let the kids direct the play, and try to make them laugh as much as possible (without tickling them), but typically playlistening is done to adjust behavior.\nStaylistening is what you do when a child is crying, having a tantrum, etc. You simply sit with the child, potentially give them a gentle touch (if it makes them cry harder, this is good - don\u0026rsquo;t touch them if it stops them from crying), and occasionally remind them of the thing they were crying about (\u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re out of orange juice\u0026rdquo;). You can also say reassuring things as long as they\u0026rsquo;re completely true and aren\u0026rsquo;t trying to solve a problem (\u0026ldquo;you can have orange juice another day\u0026rdquo;).\nSpecial Time is unique as the only technique you broadcast and identify to your child. It\u0026rsquo;s a time when you agree to do anything your child wants. It should be scheduled ahead of time (usually) and should always be timed. Even 10 minutes is perfectly good. This is a time for your child to establish a connection with you and invite you into his/her world.\nSetting Limits is more or less what it sounds like, although it\u0026rsquo;s defined somewhat more broadly than you might imagine (\u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;re going to Aunt Patty\u0026rsquo;s now\u0026rdquo;). Interestingly, setting limits is often coupled with gentle physical coercion. The idea here is not to obtain immediate compliance, but to give your off-track child the pretext they need to get well and truly upset. This, obviously, does not mean that you should set unreasonable limits on purpose.\nListening Partnerships are a thing you do with another adult, not your child. They\u0026rsquo;re important because everything in Hand in Hand has to come from a place of genuine love and interest. Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re too stressed out or triggered by your child\u0026rsquo;s behavior to Staylisten. In this case, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t fake it! You should gently tell your child that you can\u0026rsquo;t listen to them right now. Listening partnerships are essentially a therapy technique to help you execute the rest of the Hand in Hand approach correctly.\nI want to emphasize again, because all of the names here are so goofy, that the whole picture of this is worth taking seriously. It is the job of children to cry and throw fits. It is the job of adults to give them the pretext and safety in which to do so. Absolutely missing from this is any sense that adults are here to impart wisdom, discipline, or any other virtue onto children. In fact, Wipfler even discourages having your child name the emotion they\u0026rsquo;re having. Your child is already doing nonconceptual/somatic energy work and doesn\u0026rsquo;t need you to impose paradigms they\u0026rsquo;ll later have to hope to unlearn.\nMy best argument for using the techniques in Listen (though it\u0026rsquo;s not in the book), is something like: everyone has a bunch of people in their head. Most of these people are mental models of their friends and family, and some of the first and most influential people that get to live in your head are your mental models of your parents. If, as a parent, you use this as an opportunity to install a mental model that is boundlessly compassionate towards and permissive of your child\u0026rsquo;s emotions, you will be giving them a tremendous gift.\nHow Children Learn, by John Holt John Holt is famous for sparking the unschooling movement, all the way back in the 1960s. The two books that made him and his philosophy famous were this one and its predecessor, How Children Fail, which were written by Holt after a six-year stint teaching elementary school. Over the course of several more books on education, Holt became increasingly convinced that the educational system could not be reformed, and that homeschooling was the only realistic option. How Children Learn is an interesting book partially because it outlines a philosophy seems very palatable until it eventually leads to unschooling - which is so contentious that many of my otherwise very open-minded friends refuse to consider it.\nI think John Holt would like Listen, but How Children Learn one-ups it by increasing the parable density to something quite close to 100%. The brilliance of the book is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t shove its ideas in your face, it just tells you some charming stories about kids and lets you draw your own conclusion. For example, on math:\n\u0026hellip;But the matter of freedom, to choose how to do this, or to choose not to do it, is all important. Long before the “New Math” had ever been heard of, before the great boom in curriculum reform was under way, Bill Hull was trying to get his fifth-grade classes to do some real, original, problem-directed thinking. One piece of equipment he used was a balance beam, a piece of wood balanced at its midpoint, with places along the arms to put weights. The children were supposed to figure out the principle of the beam, so that, whatever weight we put on one side, they could balance it with weights on the other. In How Children Fail I described some of the work that very bright fifth-graders did with this beam. One girl, that I can remember, seemed to know how to do at least the simple balancing problems—two weights on one side balancing one on the other. Hardly anyone else in the class could consistently work out even simple problems; most of them never got beyond the guessing stage. And this in spite of the fact that we—or so we thought—had done everything possible to set up a situation that would make discovery more easy. We worked with the children in small groups; we gave each child an easy problem; we encouraged the other children in the group to say whether they thought this solution to the problem was correct, and if not, why not. We thought we had set up in our class a laboratory in miniature, and that the children would accordingly act like scientists. But we hadn’t, and they didn’t, for just this reason, that it was our problem they were working on, not theirs.\nTwo years later, when I was teaching my own fifth grade, I borrowed some extra balance beams from Bill, to see whether my students could make anything of them. I put these beams, and some weights to hang on them, on a table at one end of my classroom. Then I had a piece of undeserved good luck. Before I had a chance to do any talking or explaining or instructing about these beams, some children came in early one morning and saw them. “What’s that stuff?” they said. I said, “Oh, some junk I got from Bill Hull.” They said, “What’s it for?” I said, “Nothing special; mess around with it if you want to.” Three or four of them went down to the end table and began to fool around. As other children arrived they went down to watch. By half an hour later, almost all the kids who had been working with the beams knew how to work them—including some who were not good students. I gave one of them one of the problems that had in earlier years given very able students so much trouble. She solved it easily and showed that she knew what she was doing. I said, “You have any trouble figuring that out?” She said, “Oh no, it was cinchy.”\nNot long after, Bill Hull and some other friends of mine were developing a very ingenious and powerful set of mathematical and logical materials (now produced by the McGraw-Hill Book Company in New York City) called Attribute Blocks or A-blocks. These are a set of wooden blocks, of various colors, sizes, and shapes, with which children can play a wide variety of classifying games, and with which they do a great many things that experts on such matters have said they would be unable to do.\nThey developed these materials by having small groups of young children, mostly five-year-olds, come into their office-lab-classroom and work with them, that is, play various games, do puzzles, solve problems. (Some of the games now incorporated into the unit were invented by the children.) They found a very interesting thing about the way children reacted to these materials. If, when a child came in for the first time, they tried to get him “to work” right away, to play some of their games and solve some of their puzzles, they got nowhere. The child would try to do what he was asked to do, but without joy or insight. But if at first they let the child alone for a while, let him play with the materials in his own way, they got very different results. At first, the children would work the pieces of wood into a fantasy. Some pieces would be mommies and daddies, some children; or they would be houses and cars; or big animals and little animals. Then the children would make various kinds of patterns, buildings, and constructions out of the pieces of wood. When, through such play and fantasy, the children had taken these materials into their minds, mentally swallowed and digested them, so to speak, they were then ready and willing to play very complicated games, that in the more organized and businesslike situation had left other children completely baffled. This proved to be so consistently true that the experimenters made it a rule always to let children have a period of completely free play with the materials, before asking them to do directed work with them.\nHolt sort of leads with a claim here, about freedom being \u0026ldquo;all-important,\u0026rdquo; but the rest of the section is just a couple of anecdotes about children learning in different classroom environments. To me, at least, it\u0026rsquo;s both charming and convincing - but taken to its logical conclusion, this concept would turn modern schooling on its head. What do you do with the children who aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in the balance beams? How do you turn the beams into a standardized test? The only option would seem to be a highly individualized curriculum, with teachers acting more as mentors than sources of divine authority, and students given free reign to direct their own education (while still being very gently guided, to some extent, along useful paths of inquiry). Virtually all standardized testing would be useless in this world, because the children would be expected to pursue their own various interests.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s another passage from How Children Learn:\nBy this time, I knew better than to try to give these materials the hard sell; children learn very early to be wary of too much adult enthusiasm. So, instead of saying, “Oh, Lisa, I’ve brought the most exciting things for you to look at, wait till you see them, we’re going to have such fun with them…,” I merely left the charts in my room, where I knew she’d see them when she went in to explore. Sure enough, a few days later, she asked me, “What are those big signs in your room?” I said, “You mean those things with the colored letters all over them?” Yes. I said that they were things I had to use at school with children who were learning to read. She said, “Can I use them?” I said, “Why, sure, I suppose, if you want to.” She said, “I mean, right now.” So we took the charts into the living room, spread a few of them on the rug, and began to work.\nOrdinarily a teacher using these charts points to certain words and asks children what they are. But I had learned by this time that even little children can get very frightened, cautious, and defensive when put into a spot where they have to give an answer which may be wrong. What I did was to give Lisa a pointer, and invite her to ask me what any word said, or, if she felt that she knew what it said, to say it herself. In other words, I was trying to put her out of danger and in control of the game. For a while, we played this way; she asked me words, I told them to her, sometimes she knew a word and would say it herself. But within a very short while, only a few minutes, she began to change the rules of the game, to play it in a different way, her way. The older children in the family had a good friend named Henry Harrison, whom Lisa knew, and she began to amuse herself by pointing to various three and four letter words on the chart and saying, “Henry Harrison!” I tried gently to steer the game back to where it had been, but no use. It was clear that she was not only tired of the game, but beginning actively to dislike it. Sure enough, in another minute or so she said she wanted to stop, we put the charts away, and for the rest of the visit she did not ask to see them again.\nThis was a mystery. Why, when I had been so careful not to put her on the spot, did she so quickly turn away from these materials, that she herself had demanded to use? This happened again, with some quite different materials, on a later visit. Only after some time and much thought, did I begin to suspect what the trouble had been. No matter how hard I tried to keep the game unthreatening, to avoid putting her in a spot where she might be wrong, I could not hide the fact that this was a game about which I knew everything and she nothing, and this alone was more threatening and humiliating than she was willing or able to bear\u0026hellip;\nWhat I should have done is let Lisa use those charts however she wanted, give her time to fantasize and play with them (if she wanted), let her show me what use, if any, she wanted to make of them, let her ask me questions about them, if she wanted to do that. But even if I and she had done all those things, I doubt very much that she would have used the charts to teach herself to read, as Gattegno, their author, intended. When, a short time later, she did begin this work, what she used was real books.\nWhat I pick up on here isn\u0026rsquo;t a philosophy of how to teach children, but a philosophy of how to treat children. Lisa learned to read by initiating the learning herself - she wasn\u0026rsquo;t taught. Attempts to teach her, even very gentle ones, actively repulsed her from learning to read by putting her in a position of feeling stupid and powerless. As Holt observes, Lisa\u0026rsquo;s issue is, if anything, that she cares too much about reading ability - so much so that she can\u0026rsquo;t stand being reminded that it\u0026rsquo;s something she isn\u0026rsquo;t yet good at.\nHolt has a number of other cute stories, especially around children learning to swim. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re unconvinced about unschooling for one reason or another, I wholeheartedly recommend it as an opportunity to appreciate and empathize with young people.\nThoughts Unschooling and Coercion It\u0026rsquo;s tempting for me to describe unschooling as non-coercive learning (which is a very common way to describe it and often how the movement describes itself), but in reality I\u0026rsquo;m not sure that non-coercion is the entire story. In fact, I think there are some things (math being an excellent example) which we should expect to require years of effort before they become natural and useful, but which are ultimately too valuable to pass over. With enough skill, it is certainly possible to non-coercively guide children to learn an appropriate amount of math (which I\u0026rsquo;ll define as math up to calculus and linear algebra) under their own motivation; I have seen it happen. But, even as someone who mostly hangs out with engineers, I know perhaps three people who do math for fun (maybe closer to ten if you count relatively small amounts of math done incidentally for personal projects). I think the heuristic of being non-coercive can get you a long way, but it also leaves too much value on the table to be the whole story.\nThis is supported by the fact that in the ACX survey, unschooled participants had worse math SAT scores than traditionally schooled participants. In some sense this is completely expected: of course people raised in an environment that completely de-emphasizes standardized test performance will perform worse on standardized tests. Unfortunately, unschooling does terribly in the survey in general (unschoolers have some of the lowest life satisfaction, social satisfaction, and satisfaction with their schooling, even after controlling for religiosity). Furthermore, homeschoolers who aren\u0026rsquo;t unschooled do much better on SAT math, and are among the most satisfied with their educations, suggesting that it is specifically the features unique to unschooling which make it inferior. Again, maybe the homeschoolers have a little more standardized test experience, but it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t look good. Maybe the worse test scores are offset by intangibles like being more self-motivated and being a lifelong learner, but the respondants themselves don\u0026rsquo;t seem to feel the tradeoff was worthwhile.\nThe idea that non-coercion is an especially bad approach for things like math is also partially supported by the ACX survey: while unschoolers had significantly lower math SAT scores (688, vs an average of 737 over the other groups, which is a 0.46 standard deviation difference), they actually tied with private schoolers for having the highest verbal SAT scores. I think the best explanation for this is that if you give young children with limited ability to make good long-term decisions too much autonomy, they\u0026rsquo;ll naturally create self-reinforcing cycles of \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not a math person, so I won\u0026rsquo;t do very much math.\u0026rdquo;\nAn alternative explanation of the observations in How Children Learn, fueled by a synthesis of these books, might be that children can\u0026rsquo;t learn well when they\u0026rsquo;re not in emotional regulation. This suggests that children might have greater tolerance for coerced learning activities (like math) if you give them plenty of opportunities to feel smart, capable, and in charge - before, during, and after the work they\u0026rsquo;re not as enthusiastic about. With this condition met, Wipfler would probably tell us that children will only need a bit of prompting to painlessly incorporate math into their daily curriculum. In this view, committed unschoolers make an interesting mistake: they try too hard to be moral, when they should be devoting their efforts to staying considerate and connected. Children actually don\u0026rsquo;t want to be non-coerced, they want to feel capable and loved and in control of their lives.\nPersonal Development Listen is an excellent book for people who, like me, didn\u0026rsquo;t learn healthy relationships with their emotions when they were young. As you put yourself in the place of parents embracing the emotions of their children, you can start to pattern similar modes of interaction with your own emotions, in a very nonthreatening way. Practicing this attitude as you notice emotions arise throughout your day is, in my experience, a great complement to IFS (Internal Family Systems) and noting type practices. How Children Learn is also very useful, especially to people who have a lot of thoughts like \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not an x person\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not smart\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;I just don\u0026rsquo;t like learning things.\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s okay to have whatever preferences that you have, but a lot of those preferences around learning might be based in trauma or learned helplessness which arises predictably and systematically in the course of modern education. Speaking from personal experience, even just being aware of this can help to loosen it.\nReasonableness Wipfler claims that when one child hits another, we should devote loving attention to the aggressor (after, obviously, making sure there are no serious injuries). We might instinctively feel that we should punish the aggressor and focus our time on making sure the victim is OK; this seems much more fair. But Wipfler points out that the aggressive child is the one who can most benefit from our help in that moment. And so, we are asked to put our feelings of fairness aside and apply our effort where it can be most useful.\nThis is illustrative of a more general point: you cannot insist that children be reasonable by your definition of the word. Children are big balls of emotions over which they exercise next to zero control. They don\u0026rsquo;t have any techniques for managing their emotions (healthy or not, such techniques are adaptive) and the power of their experiences is frightening and isolating. I\u0026rsquo;d take this far enough to say that children don\u0026rsquo;t have control over their actions to the same extent that adults do. So while it may seem completely unreasonable to you that your child would steal a toy, or hit another child, or throw a full-fledged fit in the middle of the supermarket because they\u0026rsquo;re out of his favorite brand of spaghetti, there is another view in which you are the person being unreasonable by expecting a tangle of fear and frustration and unprocessed trauma to consistently play by your rules.\nNote on Emotional Development It may seem that I\u0026rsquo;ve claimed at different points in this review that children are both more and less emotionally developed than adults, so I wanted to briefly address this. You can imagine around three ways to respond to a strong \u0026ldquo;negative\u0026rdquo; emotion: resistance, cope, and flow. Babies and young children mostly let their emotions flow, and start resisting their emotions more as they become older. Resisting emotions is difficult and exhausing, so we eventually learn coping mechanisms to bypass, cut off, or ignore our emotions. However, coping techniques are not the endpoint of emotional development. Coping techniques are useful for getting through the day, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t so much ways to deal with emotions as ways to avoid them. The best strategy to deal with emotions will probably combine all three strategies, letting emotions flow where possible and using coping mechanisms and potentially resistance as crutches when necessary. I imagine that, having developed correct view, you can let your emotions flow all the time with no need for coping mechanisms. In this way, highly emotionally developed people strongly resemble children. However, the resistance and cope techniques provide safety and opportunities to develop these healthier attitudes towards/relationships with your emotions.\nResponsibility An interesting lens on these works could be that they are encouraging you to relinquish responsibility for certain aspects of your child\u0026rsquo;s life. Wipfler claims that children are experts at processing their emotions (or at least that they are processing their emotions in the best possible way given their relative lack of life experience), and that their natural good-naturedness is sufficient to make them cooperative when they\u0026rsquo;re in an emotionally regulated state. In other words, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to take responsibility for making your child feel better, or for resolving their behavioral issues; you just need to give them the opportunity to address their own problems. Similarly, Holt claims that children are passionate and effective learners when they are given reason to believe that something is actually worth learning. Maybe a good way to think about it is something like: you don\u0026rsquo;t teach children, you just create conditions for them to learn (and similar for processing their own emotions). Having created the conditions, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to manage the process or sweat the outcome.\nGeneral Note Most of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve discussed about children can probably apply in some way to relationships with other adults.\n"

                "body": "Spend some time paying attention to neurological stuff\nThis will be a shortish post with a few observations:\nA few months ago, a friend told me he\u0026rsquo;d gone from not being able to touch his toes to putting his palms on the floor in a couple of weeks by following a stretching routine that was based on the idea that flexibility is mostly neurological: when our nervous system detects that we\u0026rsquo;re approaching the boundaries of our range of motion, it tenses our muscles automatically to stop the movement. You can address this first by doing mild strength training at the edge your range of motion, and second by alternately clenching and relaxing the relevant muscles as you stretch. The strength training teaches your body that it can actually handle loads in this range and it\u0026rsquo;s not in danger. Clenching the muscle intentionally and then relaxing it briefly overrides your neurological brakes and allows you to stretch much more effectively. Also a few months ago, I saw a cool YouTube video where a PRI-trained physical therapist named Conor Harris explains how he discovered that a patient\u0026rsquo;s glasses were making his peripheral vision worse on one side, so whenever the patient took a step on that side half of his body would tense up. The patient claims to have experienced debilitating pain for years before seeing Harris; his problem ended up being entirely neurological (in a way that most specialists never would have solved). Since a few weeks ago, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing Harris\u0026rsquo; excellent Beginner Body Restoration course. It\u0026rsquo;s a 6-week course where you do 3 sets of 5 exercises every day, with the exercises changing every other week. As you might expect, all of the exercises are done at a 3/10 intensity, with the goal of training your brain and nervous system to safely reproduce various motion patterns rather than pure strength training. The Beginner Body Restoration course has made a bigger difference for me than any other exercise thing I\u0026rsquo;ve tried, by far Last week, I read (most of) Peter Nobes\u0026rsquo; Mindfulness in 3D, which is essentially a sales pitch for the Alexander Technique. I read it mostly because Peter Nobes is Michael Ashcroft\u0026rsquo;s AT teacher, and Michael Ashcroft has some great stuff, but I disliked it very much, and I try not to do book reviews of books I don\u0026rsquo;t think have a lot to offer. That said, one really surprising thing from the book was when Nobes mentioned that during his sessions, he often asks people where they think the joints between their hips and femurs are, and where the joint between the top of the cervical spine and the skull is. If you don\u0026rsquo;t already know, you can take a second and guess. Nobes points out that most people think their spine-skull joint is essentially on the back of their neck, and that their hip joints are up near the iliac crest. You can look up images of where they actually are once you\u0026rsquo;re ready. And the strange thing was, knowing where my spine actually met my skull changed the way I held my head. Not exactly neurological, but neurological/mental? So now I\u0026rsquo;m planning to see a PRI therapist and then an AT teacher. But more importantly, I\u0026rsquo;m totally blown away by the fact that this never came up before. I\u0026rsquo;ve been to physical therapy many times and talked to lots of doctors about joint problems; everyone talked about strength, some people talked about range of motion, and no one talked about neurology or repatterning movement. Paying attention to neurological stuff seems like an effective fitness force multiplier - maybe literally, in some cases.\n"

                "date" : "2023.08.05",
                "body": "A review of Outlive, by Peter Attia, with a tl;dr at the end because it\u0026rsquo;s like 13 pages long\nPeter Attia is the first person I would want to write a book on extending healthspan. Attia spent his undergraduate years studying to be an aerospace engineer before eventually going to medical school and entering private practice as a primary care doctor to the 1%, who pay him $150,000 a year to extend their lives. In his book, Outlive, Attia combines an engineer\u0026rsquo;s talent for optimization and quantitative analysis with a clinician\u0026rsquo;s pragmatism. While it does at times feel like it\u0026rsquo;s designed to promote his practice, Outlive is a genuinely useful book for those of us who can\u0026rsquo;t afford Attia\u0026rsquo;s rate.\nAs I read Outlive, I couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but think about David Sinclair\u0026rsquo;s successful 2019 book, Lifespan. In many ways, Attia and Sinclair have opposite views on longevity, and the two of them seem to know each other and talk, so it\u0026rsquo;s weird to me that neither of them appear to have publicly noticed that they disagree so strongly.\nSinclair takes a \u0026ldquo;candle\u0026rdquo; view of longevity: an oversimplification is that our bodies have a certain pool of metabolic resources and epigenetic fault-tolerance and that aging (well, technically senescence) is the exhaustion of this pool (burning down the candle). So Sinclair is careful to avoid \u0026ldquo;burning his candle at both ends\u0026rdquo; (a phrase he actually uses in his book), practicing both caloric restriction and fasting. He also has a lot of \u0026ldquo;longevity hacks\u0026rdquo; like sauna, cold exposure, and various drugs, which, as you\u0026rsquo;d expect from a researcher, he spends a good deal of time enthusing about in his book.\nAttia, meanwhile, takes a \u0026ldquo;banking\u0026rdquo; view of longevity: the oversimplification here is that since nearly all physical abilities inevitably degrade over the long run, we need to put a lot of them in the bank to have a buffer for later. Attia wants to maintain high physical performance for as long as possible, so he advocates eating a gram of protein per pound of body weight every single day (for me, this would be like nine protein shakes). Obviously, this is combined with a very ambitious physical training program. Caloric restriction and fasting are discouraged in all but the most severe cases of metabolic dysfunction on the grounds that they will cause you to lose muscle mass. Sauna is briefly mentioned in the Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s chapter, and a handful of drugs (a few statins and rapamycin) are mentioned by name but don\u0026rsquo;t receive much attention.\nI genuinely don\u0026rsquo;t know to make of these radically different models and wish Attia and Sinclair would address them. One way to sum up this difference is that Attia expects physical decay due to aging to happen significantly faster than Sinclair does - which perhaps gives Sinclair a little more credibility. A lot of Attia\u0026rsquo;s stats in the book appear to come from averages without intervention, and when he looks at older people who are making some significant effort to improve, he often finds that they\u0026rsquo;re either holding off decline pretty effectively or even improving. This would suggest that we\u0026rsquo;re more likely than Attia acknowledges to get away with a more Sinclair-style approach. But since I don\u0026rsquo;t know much about medicine, my final analysis won\u0026rsquo;t rely much on this:\nSinclair, I assume, is ultimately chasing prestige, and getting mice to live slightly longer is his proxy for that. Based on the vibe from his book I suspect that Attia is also chasing prestige, but his proxy is something like positive feedback in his clinical practice over a 5-10 year time horizon. On the one hand, Attia has no reason to prefer any particular class of interventions over another (unlike Sinclair, who is incentivized to promote his own research). But on the other hand, we should expect that Attia will systematically undervalue very long-term approaches like Sinclair\u0026rsquo;s, because the candle theory probably produce worse results over any 5-10 year time horizon than the banking theory. Because of this, in absence of better information it makes a lot of sense to pay more attention to Outlive over the short term. If strong evidence supporting Sinclair comes out over the next decade (such as David Sinclair very persuasively continuing to look exactly the same as he did in the 1990\u0026rsquo;s), it might make sense to back off on some of Attia\u0026rsquo;s stuff. If not, you\u0026rsquo;re in a very good place.\nSo then, on to the book itself. Attia is concerned with two things: avoiding the most common causes of death and extending ability to perform everyday tasks. Like a good engineer, Attia continues to recursively break these down into manageable chunks, ultimately identifying four horsemen of death and five areas of intervention.\nGeneral Thoughts on Longevity A reasonable question to ask about longevity before you start trying to make changes is whether anything can improve your longevity. There are obviously lots of things that can hurt (smoking, obesity, Russian roulette, etc), but can you really improve, or is your natural lifespan mostly genetically determined? Twin studies suggest that genetics only appears to be responsible for ~20-30% of variation in lifespan near the center of the distribution, but becomes a lot more important at the tails. In other words, it\u0026rsquo;s very difficult to become a centenarian without being related to one (and more bad news: if your family tends to die young, you probably will too). However, the good news is that, as I interpret it, most people can modify their lifespans by maybe 1.5ish standard deviations (maybe 15-20 years!). But just as importantly, we can die after a relatively rapid decline and spend most of our old age as independent, capable people rather than vegetables waiting to die.\nAttia succumbs exactly once in this book to enthusiasm for an anti-aging drug and expresses a lot of optimism about rapamycin (commonly used as an immunosuppressant/immunomodulator to prevent rejection of donor organs after transplants), claiming that it\u0026rsquo;s one of the few drugs that has ever demonstrated the ability to improve lifespan but needs to be administered cyclically at high doses.\nHorseman 1: Metabolic Disorders Your blood glucose levels need to be kept incredibly stable, and this is partially the job of the liver, which must decide when to convert glycogen into glucose. But when you introduce a lot of glucose to your body, you have to store it, either as glycogen or fat. The job of insulin is to signal your cells to store excess glucose in your subcutaneous fat, which is actually healthy! One experiment transplanted extra subcutaneous fat into mice and cured their metabolic disorders because they now had extra space for their glucose. But if you don\u0026rsquo;t have enough space for all your glucose, your insulin levels start to have less impact on your blood glucose levels - you are becoming insulin resistant.\nAt this point you will start to see warning signs on a standard blood test: your fasting blood glucose will be high. If you\u0026rsquo;re not type 1 diabetic, your insulin levels have been elevated for the entire time you\u0026rsquo;ve been fasting, but you had nowhere to put your glucose and so it keeps circulating in your blood.\nYour body wants to store energy as fat, and will do this even when it has to put fat where it\u0026rsquo;s not supposed to be: as triglycerides in your blood, in between your internal organs, and even on and within your organs, reducing their efficiency. Fat in these latter two locations is called \u0026ldquo;visceral fat,\u0026rdquo; and visceral fat is a very bad sign. Visceral fat in the liver causes fatty liver disease - if you have certain levels of this and you\u0026rsquo;re not an alcoholic, then you have a metabolic disorder called Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver disease (NAFLD).\nNote that everything we\u0026rsquo;ve said here points to the fact that weight, in and of itself, is not problematic! It is possible to be obese and metabolically healthy, and it is possible to be a normal weight and metabolically unhealthy. The metabolic health, not the weight, is the key.\nHow do we monitor for signs of metabolic dysfunction? Attia lists a number of ways:\n\u0026ldquo;Liver enzyme aminotransferase\u0026rdquo; (ALT) levels in your blood. Labcorp says the acceptable maximum level is under 33 IU/L, Attia suspects something more like 30 IU/L for men or 19 IU/L for women. But he also watches for \u0026ldquo;even mildly elevated\u0026rdquo; enzymes. DEXA scans, where you can directly monitor visceral fat levels Elevated uric acid (suggests consumption of too much fructose) Elevated homocysteine (you can maybe moderate this by supplementing B vitamins?) Lipid profile, especially ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol (should be less than 2:1, ideally less than 1:1) Elevated insulin (I assume especially when fasting?) While you might think of most of these as fancy tests for rich people, you can still get a rough idea of your metabolic health with just the standard blood tests from your doctor (which should include triglycerides, cholesterol, and fasting blood glucose).\nHorseman 2: Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Your body needs cholesterol to survive, and it transports its cholesterol around in lipoproteins. A lipoprotein has a crunchy protein shell around a gooey cholerterol center, or so I like to imagine, and the the density of the lipoprotein is how much protein relative to fat (cholesterol) it has (HDL has more protein, LDL less). Lipoproteins aren\u0026rsquo;t water-soluble on their own, so they in turn are wrapped by apolipoproteins: HDL is wrapped by apoA, and LDL by apoB.\nAs they\u0026rsquo;re transported around by your blood, these apolipoproteins will occasionally become lodged in the endothelium which lines your veins. ApoA can easily pass through the endothelium and so is easily dislodged, but apoB will get stuck and oxidize, which leads to forming clumps. Your immune system and smooth muscle cells will both try to run damage control, possibly successfully, but sooner or later you\u0026rsquo;ll end up with an atherosclerotic plaque. If you run a CT angiogram, you can see these plaques, but a typical CT scan will miss them until they become calcified (basically your body trying to pour cement over the plaque to at least stabilize it).\nBut we don\u0026rsquo;t need a CT scan (which will show us damage already done) to make marginal health decisions: for this, we can simply measure our apoB, which we should do regularly as it\u0026rsquo;s an easy and relatively inexpensive test ($30 even if you have to pay out of pocket). You should start getting concerned at 70 mg/dL, but there is no minimum number for apoB - ideally, you drive it as close to zero as possible (though most likely you\u0026rsquo;ll end up somewhere around 20 if you\u0026rsquo;re very successful, and this is fine).\nHow do we lower apoB? One thing to point out is that dietary cholesterol doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter: humans synthesize their own cholesterol, and the cholesterol we eat is overwhelmingly just pooped back out. However, it appears that consumption of saturated fat can raise apoB for some people (though not for others). Attia typically has his patients make dietary changes (everyone should at least try reducing their saturated fat consumption), but he also puts almost all of his patients on statins, which improve clearance of LDL, and has them monitor their blood pressure (high blood pressure mechanically damages the endothelium and so creates more opportunities for plaques).\nAttia also mentions Lp(a), an especially bad form of apoB which you may have a predisposition towards if premature heart disease runs in your family.\nHorseman 3: Cancer This chapter of the book mainly covers a number of experimental treatment and screening methods for cancer, such as immunotherapy and liquid biopsies. While this is certainly interesting, I\u0026rsquo;m afraid it somewhat plays into what I\u0026rsquo;ll jokingly call the Sinclair Trap of telling us about cool things we might see down the road instead of helping us live longer.\nAttia\u0026rsquo;s approach to cancer is basically: we don\u0026rsquo;t really have many good ways to avoid cancer, and we\u0026rsquo;re not super great at treating it, so it\u0026rsquo;s very, very important to catch it early. Therefore, Attia recommends early and frequent screening for lung, breast, prostate, colorectal, and cervical cancer. Of these, my personal thought is that it makes sense for men to get PSA (prostate specific antigen) screenings and sigmoid colonoscopies early and often (full colonoscopies appear to have little effect on all-cause mortality). Women should get the colonoscopy, pap smear (cervical), and mammogram (breast).\nHorseman 4: Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s You might have imagined from the length of the last section that cancer is the horseman we know the least about, but this isn\u0026rsquo;t true: we know virtually nothing about Alzeheimer\u0026rsquo;s. We don\u0026rsquo;t know what mechanisms produce its symptoms, we don\u0026rsquo;t know how you get it, and we don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about how to cure it. But there are a few insights that might be helpful.\nOne of the few things we know about Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s is that a gene called APOE has a tremendous impact on whether you get it. You have two copies of APOE, each of which is either the e2, e3, or e4 variant. Most of the population has two copies of e3, which produces normal risk for Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s, but if you have at least one e2 variant, you become less likely to get it, and if you have at least one e4 then you become more likely to get it. These are sort of dose-dependent, so an e4/e4 genotype is highly likely to get Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s.\nBeyond sleep and exercise (which will reduce your risk of having basically any problem, and are the highest-priority for Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s prevention), we have two ways to prevent Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s, and both are equally weird. The first is flossing: it seems that gingivitis significantly raises your odds of getting Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s. The second is dry sauna. To quote Attia:\nThe best interpretation I can draw from the literature suggests that at least four sessions per week, of at least 20 minutes per session, at 179 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter seems to be the sweet spot to reduce the risk of Alzheimer\u0026rsquo;s by about 65% (and risk of ASCVD by 50%).\nThose are, um, huge effect sizes, wow.\nIntervention 1: Exercise Attia identifies five areas of intervention in his book: exercise, sleep, nutrition, emotional health, and drugs. Of those, I will only focus on exercise and nutrition, because Attia doesn\u0026rsquo;t talk about drugs in this book, except for statins, and his thoughts on sleep and emotional health are pretty standard fare.\nAttia believes that exercise is the most important domain in which you can intervene to improve your healthspan. He subdivides physical health/training targets into endurance, aerobic capacity, strength, and stability, and introduces the very interesting idea of the Centenarian Decathlon. Basically, Attia thinks that we should be exercising with goals in mind for when we\u0026rsquo;re in our 90s (or maybe older!). If you look at the typical decay curves in physical capabilities as people age, it turns out that you need to be quite fit in your 50s if you want to be functional and independent in your 90s. If you want to be able to pick up your grandchild, go for a hike, or carry your groceries up the stairs in a reasonable amount of time in your 90s, you may need to be performing near the level of exceptional athletes in your 50s (note: this is subject to my earlier note about Attia using average decay curves). Fortunately, Attia thinks this is an attainable goal.\nEndurance Aerobic endurance is the base on which all other exercise is built. This is where we reverse our metabolic problems and start the journey to performing at higher levels. In fact, even elite athletes (depending on their sport) might spend most of their time training in zone 2, which is where we\u0026rsquo;ll be spending our time.\nZone 2 is technically 70-85% of your maximum heart rate, but Attia suggests that we use our perceived exertion: we\u0026rsquo;re looking to feel that we can just barely hold a conversation. If you would struggle to speak a full sentence out loud, you\u0026rsquo;ve overshot; if you could easily sing, you\u0026rsquo;re not there yet. Attia himself does four 1-hour zone 2 workouts every week, and he thinks three hours a week is the minimum if you want to improve.\nIf you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a number to improve here, you want to see your body\u0026rsquo;s metabolism getting more efficient by producing a greater wattage per kilogram of weight. Oftentimes stationary bikes will show you your output as a wattage. Elite athletes tend to perform at around 4 watts/kg - metabolically unhealthy people are around 1 watt/kg.\nAerobic Capacity (VO2 Max) A smoker has about a hazard ratio of about 1.4x relative to a nonsmoker, but someone in the bottom quartile for VO2 max has a 4x greater chance of dying at any given moment relative to someone in the top quartile. Even just exiting the bottom quartile cuts your risk by 50%. So improving aerobic capacity is literally vital. To quote Attia: \u0026ldquo;to be able to climb up four flights of stairs in your eighties, you should be able to pretty much sprint up those same stairs [in your forties].\u0026rdquo; Your aerobic capacity is measured by your VO2 max, which is the maximum rate at which your body can consume oxygen. After you reach the age of 50, VO2 max declines at a rate of roughly 10% per decade on average, and once it reaches 15-18 ml/kg/min it begins to threaten your ability to live on your own.\nHowever, aerobic capacity is quite trainable even in older people, who might expect to see 17% improvement over the course of a year. Attia doesn\u0026rsquo;t start his patients on aerobic training until they\u0026rsquo;ve done 6 months of endurance work, and his VO2 max workouts are similar to HIIT, but \u0026ldquo;a bit longer\u0026hellip; and a notch less intense.\u0026rdquo; They typically follow a 4-4-4 pattern: 4 minutes on (at the maximum intensity you can sustain for 4 minutes), 4 minutes off (at a low but nonzero intensity - should be enough for your heart rate to fall below 100 bpm), for 4-6 sets. In addition to having a warmup and cooldown, the 4 minutes off are important to recover as completely as possible: if you fail to cool down, you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to reach maximum effort in the next set. Attia typically has his patients do this just once a week.\nStability Stability is to strength as endurance is to aerobic capacity. What I mean by this is that stability is explicitly not balance. Instead, it\u0026rsquo;s the subconscious ability to safely and effectively exert force. A person with good stability produces safe and effective patterns of motion without having to think about it. A stable person is versatile and seldom injures themselves.\nStability is undermined at a number of points. Over time, particularly when we spend a lot of our lives sitting, muscle groups develop relative strengths that are poorly suited to our bodies\u0026rsquo; mechanics. We may exacerbate this process ourselves by developing asymmetric strength or compensating inappropriately for injuries. We fail to notice this process because we don\u0026rsquo;t have proper awareness of our bodies, leading us to continue to enact unhelpful patterns.\nAttia takes this very seriously, and typically asks his new patients to stop any strength training they\u0026rsquo;re doing until they\u0026rsquo;ve appropriately trained stability. Unfortunately, the set of weaknesses and compensations you\u0026rsquo;ve developed will probably be pretty unique to you, and the best way to address them is likely with a trainer. Attia recommends the Postural Restoration Institute\nAs an example of what stability is trying to achieve, try this exercise: take a deep breath in through your nose that fills the entire cylinder of your torso, expanding your chest, stomach, sides, and back while pushing your pelvis down. When you exhale, maintain the tension in all of these areas, activating the entire cylinder of muscle around your torso in isometric compression. This cylinder of muscle is your actual core, and protects your spine. Next time you have some yard work that\u0026rsquo;s hard on your back, try doing it with this cylinder activated the entire time; you\u0026rsquo;ll find that your work is easier and less painful.\nWhile nothing complete, Attia also has some videos relevant to stability on his website. He also recommends that you videotape your workouts (or at least a few sets) every day to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re doing what you think you are.\nStrength Though not as dramatic as VO2 max, strength is still associated with dramatically lower mortality (low muscle strength is associated with a 2x increase in mortality, so strength should reduce mortality by like 50%). Furthermore, strength is key to maintaining your independence and lifestyle. It\u0026rsquo;s extraordinarily hard to build muscle after the age of 65 or so, and by 75 you need to work out quite a lot just to avoid losing muscle. So it\u0026rsquo;s quite important to build a buffer that allows you to maintain your quality of life. Note that we\u0026rsquo;re talking about strength here, not muscle mass or hypertrophy (which is correlated, but muscle mass produced a smaller effect size, which I suspect was mediated entirely by that correlation). Moreover, this improvement seems to be more or less independent of aerobic capacity: being strong will still reduce your mortality even if you\u0026rsquo;re not aerobically healthy. A possible mechanism for this might be bone mineral density (BMD), which closely tracks muscular strength: after the age of 65, up to a third of people who fall and fracture their hips are dead within a year. Having strong bones can help make you resilient at a time in your life when you become increasingly likely to fall in the first place. You can track your BMD with a DEXA scan (the same thing that you use to measure visceral fat).\nIt\u0026rsquo;s important to train strength throughout your life, but building a buffer as soon as possible is wise: strength typically appears to begin declining as early as your thirties, and it becomes quite difficult to add muscle once you reach your sixties. Furthermore, our body quickly gets rid of unused muscles, especially as we age, so that more than a couple of days of rest can erase gains in the gym. While muscles are metabolically expensive (and thus good at burning extra calories), the reverse is also true: consuming excess calories can lead to muscle loss.\nAttia focuses on four areas of strength:\nGrip strength, \u0026ldquo;which involves everything from your hands to your lats\u0026rdquo; (test: dead hang from a pullup bar, looking for 2 minutes for 40-year-old men, 90 seconds for women) Attention to concentric and eccentric loading (concentric is ability to apply force as you contract a muscle; eccentric is ability to apply it as you extend that muscle). Here the emphasis is on control, even as we lower the weight. (Test for eccentric strength: stepping off of an 18-inch block and taking a full 3 seconds to reach the ground) Pulling motions, like rows and pull-ups (test: probably pullups but Attia doesn\u0026rsquo;t say. He likes to use a rowing machine, which is also nice for VO2 max training) Hip hinging, like deadlifts, squats, step-ups, hip thrusters, split-stance Romanian deadlift, etc. (legs, glutes, lower back) (Attia doesn\u0026rsquo;t give a test for this either; usually it would be a deadlift but you should be careful on form here) I\u0026rsquo;m not quite as convinced as Attia is by the grip strength area: he bases his enthusiasm on a number of studies correlating grip strength with lower mortality, but it seems most likely to me that this would just be a confound for overall muscular strength? In fact, Attia even admits this himself, but continues to train grip strength, apparently on the basis that having a strong grip might enable you to grab onto a branch really hard to prevent yourself from falling (with Attia\u0026rsquo;s expanded definition of grip strength, you would also be relying on your training to prevent a rotator cuff injury here - it might be better to learn how to fall).\nTo reiterate: you can injure yourself strength training. It\u0026rsquo;s way more important to have good movement patterns than it is to lift heavy weights. You should go into workouts with the mindset of wanting to do as few motions incorrectly as possible - even if that means cutting the workout short if you start to struggle.\nIntervention 2: Nutrition The chapter on nutrition begins inauspiciously, with Attia insisting on the phrase \u0026ldquo;nutritional biochemistry\u0026rdquo; on the grounds that longer words are less biased than shorter ones. Yet despite Attia\u0026rsquo;s own lexical biases, his thoughts on nutrition are balanced and nuanced.\nOne of Attia\u0026rsquo;s best qualities is starting with the most essential questions, and here the questions are: how can we expect nutrition to impact healthspan, and do we know how to produce the impacts we want? And refreshingly, Attia says: poor nutrition can hurt your lifespan, but hyper-optimized nutrition is unlikely to help it. And even if we wanted to hyper-optimize nutrition, we don\u0026rsquo;t know how.\nPart of the difficulty with nutrition is that different people seem to respond to the same diet in vastly different ways. For example, some people seem to not only tolerate saturated fats well but benefit from them. But for many other people, eating saturated fat raises their levels of apoB (see: ASCVD). So it\u0026rsquo;s hard to give one-size-fits-all diet advice. However, as Attia points out, it\u0026rsquo;s very common in the nutrition world to \u0026ldquo;major in the minor and minor in the major.\u0026rdquo; If we avoid doing this, we will find it easier to develop diets that work well for us.\nThe three key criteria when designing your diet are:\nNumber of calories (to ensure proper nourishment) Amount of protein (to ensure you can build muscle) Level of carbohydrates (to control metabolic health) Attia on Diets There are three ways to diet:\nCaloric restriction, which means you just eat less Dietary restriction, which means you eat less by not eating certain foods Time restriction, which means you eat less by giving yourself less time in which to eat Attia thinks that you should do whatever works for you, but notes that fasting can result in a loss of muscle mass. Therefore, he only recommends fasting to patients for whom metabolic health is a pressing issue.\nAlcohol Most of the studies that find links between \u0026ldquo;moderate\u0026rdquo; alcohol consumption and longevity are poorly designed. No amount of alcohol has been established to be healthy, and you should restrict alcohol where it won\u0026rsquo;t impact your ability to enjoy your life.\nCarbs Different people handle carbs differently - the less metabolically healthy you are, the more harmful carbs will tend to be (creating a vicious cycle - see Metabolic Disorders). The mechanism of this harm is that carbs will tend to flood your bloodstream with glucose, which has to be dealt with as previously described. If you want to see how carbs impact your blood glucose, a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) may be a good idea. You\u0026rsquo;re looking for minimal, quickly-suppressed variations in your blood glucose (basically: minimize the standard deviation). CGM technically isn\u0026rsquo;t available without a prescription, but Ageless Rx will write you a prescription for one and sell it to you for $200/month. This is a lot, but you only need it for a couple of months to discover and cement beneficial behaviors (plus maybe one a year thereafter to double-check that things are still working).\nNote that there are lots of things that can impact blood glucose, which you can use to eat food you like while legitimately doing less damage to yourself. Drinking lemon juice mixed with water after a lot of glucose may spread out the load some, and eating high-fiber foods at the same time will have a similar effect. Getting your glucose after a period of fasting (like when you wake up) or exercise will also help.\nAttia wants your blood glucose at or below 100 mg/dL on average, with standard deviation less than 15 mg/dL. This average is quite aggressive.\nProtein The standard recommendation I always heard for protein for building muscle was 0.5 g/lb, or 1.1 g/kg. Attia sets 1.6 g/kg as the minimum, and thinks 2.2 g/kg (1 g/lb), spread out over a full day, is ideal. As I mentioned before, this would be nine protein shakes for me. Alternately, I could eat 30 oz of meat (3 medium steaks and maybe a chicken breast). If you\u0026rsquo;re eating plant protein, Attia thinks you need even more because it\u0026rsquo;s less bioavailable (maybe 1.3x as an approximate factor).\nFat Attia broadly recommends eating mostly monounsaturated fatty acids (55%), a bit of saturated fat (20%) and the remainder polyunsaturated fatty acids (25%), but notes that overall effect sizes here seem to be quite small. Probably this is not because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter what kinds of far you eat, but mostly (by my reading) because it matters how sensitive you are to saturated fat - specifically, what it does to your apoB levels. If you seem to be able to eat a ton of saturated fat without problems (as measured by the blood test), great. Otherwise, it might be time to cut back on the steak and coconut oil.\nAttia also puts all of his patients on omega-3 supplements to fix their omega 3:6 ratios, unless they already eat a ton of fatty fish.\nOverview of Actionable Items Upsettingly, unlike Sinclair, Peter Attia does not give us a place to go in his book to look at so we can see what we\u0026rsquo;re supposed to do (note: Sinclair\u0026rsquo;s section, at the very end, is technically about what he does, and to his credit he is very explicit that it may not be best for others or even himself - but it\u0026rsquo;s in his book for a reason). Is it some gambit to force us to read the whole thing and absorb the Tao of Attia? Well, I want something short to refer back to:\nRandom Sauna (at least four sessions per week, of at least 20 minutes per session, at 179 degrees Fahrenheit or hotter) Floss Frequent cancer screenings if you\u0026rsquo;re over 40 Bloodwork Your bloodwork will help you monitor for signs of metabolic disorders and ASCVD. For metabolic disorders, make sure:\nBlood glucose \u0026lt; 100 mg/dL (aggressive) Triglycerides \u0026lt; 100 mg/dL Triglyceride:HDL ratio less than 2:1, preferably close to 1:1 apoB as low as possible (ideally 20-30 mg/dL) Blood Pressure High blood pressure can damage your endothelium and increase your ASCVD risk. Blood pressure is also cheap to monitor, even at home, and easy to modify with medication.\nBody Composition (DEXA - 1x/yr) The important factors here are amount of visceral fat and bone mineral density:\nVisceral fat (these numbers do not come from the book, they\u0026rsquo;re from a random data aggregation website, meaning that they came from a bunch of very health-conscious people)\nMen\nAge Range In the _ Percentile 15% 35% 65% 85% Mean 19-25 Visceral Fat in lbs 0.12 0.34 0.72 1.33 0.74 26-32 Visceral Fat in lbs 0.23 0.52 1.07 1.92 1.05 33-40 Visceral Fat in lbs 0.37 0.77 1.62 2.79 1.53 41-50 Visceral Fat in lbs 0.56 1.12 2.29 3.71 2.07 51-60 Visceral Fat in lbs 0.75 1.44 2.88 4.49 2.56 60+ Visceral Fat in lbs 0.93 1.82 3.44 5.08 2.93 Women\nAge Range In the _ Percentile 15% 35% 65% 85% Mean 19-25 Visceral Fat in lbs 0.02 0.16 0.46 .93 0.55 26-32 Visceral Fat in lbs 0.04 0.20 .54 1.12 .64 33-40 Visceral Fat in lbs 0.09 0.28 .71 1.46 .80 41-50 Visceral Fat in lbs 0.16 .40 1.03 1.96 1.05 51-60 Visceral Fat in lbs 0.25 .59 1.39 2.44 1.32 60+ Visceral Fat in lbs 0.47 .92 1.82 2.85 1.63 BMD (bone mineral density) You\u0026rsquo;ll receive a T-score, which compares your BMD to that of a healthy young adult. A T-score of 0 is equivalent, less than -1 is bad. More than 0 is extra credit.\nWaist:height ratio This is a reasonable proxy for body composition, and you ideally want it below 1:2\nExercise Metrics Endurance: watts/kg (ideally close to 4) Aerobic capacity: VO2 max (perform well on a chart you find online) Stability: ??? check with a personal trainer or something, there\u0026rsquo;s also a test where you put one foot in front of the other and close your eyes and try to stay like that for 10 seconds Strength: deadhang, step-down, pull-ups, maybe deadlift (no guidelines here, more is universally better) "

The ball heading for your face (and, especially, your feelings about this situation) are way more real than any energy conservation argument.\nA big part of this realness, I think, is availability, or how easy it is to imagine an outcome.

And to some extent that\u0026rsquo;s a good thing. This heuristic works most of the time, and you probaby wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be here if your ancestors hadn\u0026rsquo;t evolved instincts that stopped heavy objects from hitting them in the face.

It\u0026rsquo;s often easy to know, intellectually, what the right thing to do is, but it\u0026rsquo;s hard to do that thing unless you already felt like it. I think another way to frame this is that your knowledge of the right thing to do doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel real to you. Most people struggle to ask other people out because they\u0026rsquo;re afraid of getting rejected. This is way illogical: if you suppose there\u0026rsquo;s a universal total ordering on preference of who to date (note: I am aware that this is not how it works), then dating is a stable matching problem, and the best solution is for you to ask people out in order of preference until one of them says yes. This maximizes your rejections, in that before you settle down, every single person who would reject you has already done so. Avoiding rejection is therefore the exact opposite of what you want to do. This is fairly obvious, and I have a very hard time imagining that I\u0026rsquo;m the first person to come up with it. There\u0026rsquo;s also another point, which is that getting shot down actually doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel very bad and can in fact be sort of fun. And yet: almost no one rejection-maxxes in real life. In other words, I think most people systematically don\u0026rsquo;t take their ideas seriously enough, and that this leads them to both miss out on positive value and generate negative value. That said, my experience is that people are distributed across an extraordinarily broad and also multidimensional domain of how seriously they take their own ideas. As a few examples of dimensions:\nAbstract vs concrete - I think you should be taking abstract ideas about as seriously as concrete ones, after adjusting for confidence High vs low confidence - Penalizing low confidence seems to be reasonable, but you should remember to penalize consistently (ie, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take low-confidence negative predictions very seriously) Easy vs hard to visualize - Should be taking these equally seriously unless you\u0026rsquo;re intentionally using availability as a low-confidence heuristic Type of risk (physical, social, etc) - You should mostly just make sure you\u0026rsquo;re calibrated on these. Social risk especially seems to get inappropriate weights (in both directions). Positive vs negative - You should be taking positive and negative forecasts about equally seriously I\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there are any good practices for taking your ideas more seriously, but probably a good place to start, as with most cognitive biases, is being aware of the mistake.\n"

Avoiding rejection is therefore the exact opposite of what you want to do. This is fairly obvious, and I have a very hard time imagining that I\u0026rsquo;m the first person to come up with it. There\u0026rsquo;s also another point, which is that getting shot down actually doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel very bad and can in fact be sort of fun. For all this, almost no one rejection-maxxes in real life. In other words, I think most people systematically don\u0026rsquo;t take their ideas seriously enough, and that this leads them to both miss out on positive value and generate negative value. That said, my experience is that people are distributed across an extraordinarily broad and also multidimensional parameter domain of how seriously they take their own ideas. As a few examples of dimensions:\nAbstract vs concrete - I think you should be taking abstract ideas about as seriously as concrete ones, after adjusting for confidence High vs low confidence - Penalizing low confidence seems to be reasonable, but you should remember to penalize consistently (ie, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t take low-confidence negative predictions very seriously) Easy vs hard to visualize - Should be taking these equally seriously unless you\u0026rsquo;re intentionally using availability as a low-confidence heuristic Type of risk (physical, social, etc) - You should mostly just make sure you\u0026rsquo;re calibrated on these. Social risk especially seems to get inappropriate weights (in both directions). Positive vs negative - You should be taking positive and negative forecasts about equally seriously I\u0026rsquo;m a bit surprised to be advocating for taking your ideas seriously, because I sometimes hear \u0026ldquo;not taking your thoughts so seriously\u0026rdquo; cited as a good mindfulness thing. I think there\u0026rsquo;s something about taking ideas seriously, but not necessarily thoughts in general and not necessarily all the time. The idea here is to be well-calibrated, and calibration issues can happen in either direction: for example, sometimes OCD manifests as frequent discursive thoughts that focus on unlikely distasters, accompanied by a feeling that you have to think about this or else it will actually happen. In general, I think it can be useful when you hear something like \u0026ldquo;x is bad\u0026rdquo; to ask yourself, \u0026ldquo;does this imply that the optimal amount of x is zero? What is the optimal amount of x?\u0026rdquo; Often I find that the heuristic of x being bad hides a lot of utility that we can derive from x in moderation.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure if there are any good practices for taking your ideas more seriously, but probably a good place to start, as with most cognitive biases, is being aware of the mistake.\n"

It was too damn hard.\n- Lt. Col. Frank Slade, \u0026ldquo;Scent of a Woman\u0026rdquo;\nAn even stronger conclusion for this quote might still feel familiar to you, as it certainly does to me: \u0026ldquo;because doing the wrong thing was a little easier.\u0026rdquo; You probably already know the classic drowning child thought experiment, due to Peter Singer:\nYou\u0026rsquo;re walking along a river when you notice a child drowning. However, if you jump into the river to save the child you will ruin your expensive suit. Is it ethical for you to ignore the child? If not, is it any more ethical to ignore the fact that the monetary equivalent of an expensive suit could save the life of a child in an impoverished country?\nThis thought experiment has been fundamental to the Effective Altruist movement, but lots of people (like me) hear about it, agree with it, and don\u0026rsquo;t immediately become EAs. I think this is actually one of the biggest problems in ethics: that it\u0026rsquo;s actually very difficult to become an ethical agent. By \u0026rsquo;ethical agent,\u0026rsquo; I mean someone who is compelled by their own ideas of right and wrong. A good example might be Atticus Finch from To Kill a Mockingbird, who, as he endangered himself and his family to stand up for his beliefs, said, \u0026ldquo;the one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience.\u0026rdquo; And yet, I think most people\u0026rsquo;s consciences are either asleep, running on default mode where they mostly agree with their in-group without really having a reason why, or else lack any normative force, such that, like Lt. Col. Slade, they \u0026ldquo;know what the right thing is,\u0026rdquo; but choose something easier instead.\nAlong those lines, I have an admission to make: a few weeks ago, I started eating meat again. I don\u0026rsquo;t really have a good reason for it, except that meat is delicious and cheap and nutritionally dense. But in my heart, I think it\u0026rsquo;s wrong to eat meat unless you have some good way to ensure that the animals were well-treated and sustainably raised. The embarassing truth is that I started eating meat again not because I found a way to meet this standard, and not because I made a principled change to my ethics that weighted thriving (by eating nutritionally dense foods) more highly relative to non-harming, but because I felt like it.\nAnd don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to be said for feeling like it. Most of the vegans I\u0026rsquo;ve met are, on some level, vegan because the feel like it: they learned about the brutality and environmental destruction endemic in the livestock industry and it resonated with them so strongly that they completely changed their livestyles. But most of the people I\u0026rsquo;ve met also know enough about that same brutality and environmental destruction to make the same choice, and don\u0026rsquo;t. And none of the vegans I know are also EAs. And so, it seems clear to me that as far as feeling like it can take you (and I do think it\u0026rsquo;s quite far), you can\u0026rsquo;t rely on that alone. Getting better as a person, probably requires ethics.\nAnd look, I have my own ideas on what it means to get better as a person, but you don\u0026rsquo;t have to agree with me on those ideas to agree with this point. Personally, I\u0026rsquo;ve been biased against ethics for a while now, partially because the professor of my mandatory undergraduate ethics class was one of the worst people I\u0026rsquo;ve ever met and I\u0026rsquo;m frankly still upset about it. But as I\u0026rsquo;ve thought about it, I\u0026rsquo;ve changed my mind about ethics, because I think the issue with that professor was that he was using ethics the same way most people use it: for post-hoc rationalization for doing what he felt like doing. In fact, that ethics class explicitly demanded that we do such rationalizations by giving assignments where we were instructed ahead of time to arrive at some specific conclusion, without giving any kind of disclaimer that this is exactly why ethics can be dangerous to smart people.\nAnd yet I think ethics can also be helpful, especially to spiritual practice. As we develop psychologically and spiritually, our default behaviors and the pressure we experience to conform to social norms restrict us less and less. Our awareness of the actions we could take at every moment opens and eventually softens - and this can lead to weirdness and bad outcomes, because we\u0026rsquo;re simultaneously dissolving both the systems we use to limit our awareness into something more manageable and the systems we use to make decisions. Simultaneously doing something more constructive - while recognizing the ultimate nebulousness/transparency/unreality of that thing - can help us with do that dissolution in a more smooth/stable way.\nLike most of my essays, this one will be missing a conclusion. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what, concretely, an \u0026rsquo;ethical practice\u0026rsquo; looks like, aside from the fact that it needs to involve both becoming more capable of being compelled by your ethics while also developing the ethics themselves. These things have to happen in tandem: you\u0026rsquo;re very unlikely to be compelled by your ethics unless your specific ethics are specifically compelling to you, and there\u0026rsquo;s no point in having ethics that you\u0026rsquo;re not compelled by.\nI also haven\u0026rsquo;t fully explored the consequences of not considering most people ethical agents. Certainly I don\u0026rsquo;t think it means that they deserve less ethical consideration. But it does mean that debating or explaining ethics to/with most people is a waste of time, unless you think those ethics will probably have normative force for yourself or the other person.\n"

                "body": "Apparently every rationalist-adjacent blogger read this book at the same time.\nI just finished reading The Geography of Madness: Penis Thieves, Voodoo Death, and the Search for Meaning in the World\u0026rsquo;s Strangest Syndromes, by Frank Bures, and it was\u0026hellip; reasonably fun. Probably the best part was getting to tell people I was reading a book about penis theft. Second best was the fun facts in the book, which were infrequent but very entertaining. For example, I learned that Chinese poet Su Dongpo was exiled from mainland China to the island of Hainan, in part for writing verses like:\nFamilies when a child is born Hope it will turn out intelligent. I, through intelligence Having wrecked my whole life, Only hope that the baby will prove Ignorant and stupid. Then he’ll be happy all his days And grow into a cabinet Minister\nExcellent.\nThe penis theft the book refers to, if you were wondering, isn\u0026rsquo;t literally happening. Instead, Bures is writing about a particular mental illness (commonly called koro) in which the sufferer believes that his penis is being or has been stolen. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to make fun of people who are clearly suffering too much, but this is also funny. One of my favorite stories in the book is about a man who insists that his penis has been stolen and is brought to a hospital. When the doctor checks and points out that everything seems to be where it belongs, the man looks down, shocked, and says that the witch who stole it must have put it back just now. I\u0026rsquo;ll do my best in the rest of the review to take koro seriously, which is probably what Bures would want.\nA lot of the rest of the book isn\u0026rsquo;t so great. Did you know that the placebo effect is real? Did you know that believing a certain health outcome will happen makes it much more likely to happen? If so, you can save yourself some time and skip a few chapters of this book. But I\u0026rsquo;m not writing about the book because it\u0026rsquo;s bad (even though I do think it\u0026rsquo;s not great) - I\u0026rsquo;m writing because it has a cool idea that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t explore enough.\nLike Scott Alexander, I\u0026rsquo;m interested in Bures\u0026rsquo; analysis of mental illness. Bures suggests that most mental illnesses are culturally conditioned, meaning that they\u0026rsquo;re so strongly filtered through perceptual lenses we absorb from our cultures that they might appear to be totally different in different cultures, or might even be nonexistent in some cultures. Unfortunately, Bures chooses the particularly bad example of PMS for this part of the book, suggesting that PMS is mostly or entirely culturally conditioned and in some sense (my words, not his) unreal. He also tries to do some political jiu-jitsu so that instead of ignoring or invalidating the lived experience of women, he\u0026rsquo;s instead taking on the partriarchy for making the sexist(?) assumption that women\u0026rsquo;s hormones can dramatically affect their moods and/or decision-making. The political/signaling aspect of this isn\u0026rsquo;t interesting to me, but it raises an interesting question: to what extent should we reify mental illness?\nImagine that you, a person who has never heard of mental illness, start feeling unmotivated and uninterested in life. The things you used to enjoy don\u0026rsquo;t interest you as much anymore and you stop maintaining your personal relationships. After a couple of weeks, a friend tells you that everyone feels bad every now and then, and this is getting out of hand. Your problems are nothing special, they tell you, you just happen to not be dealing well with this one. They point out that it will only get harder, both mentally and logistically, to engage with things that make you feel alive. Your friend points out that the best way to deal with vicious cycles is to intervene early, sometimes by radically altering your daily routine. They offer to let you sleep on their couch for a couple of weeks, and persistently push you to get out of your comfort zone, exercise regularly, etc.\nNow imagine that your friend instead takes your mental illness very seriously. You have depression, they explain to you, and it\u0026rsquo;s not your fault. Depression is a serious mental illness that impacts a huge and growing proportion of the US population. Your friend doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to blame you, the victim, so they instead point out that this could very possibly have something to do with an imbalance in your brain chemistry, or current events. After all, the climate disaster is looming, Republicans* are destroying democracy, etc. They tell you that you might need drugs or therapy and push you to make an appointment with a psychiatrist.\nThis example is a little extreme, but it\u0026rsquo;s just supposed to illustrate a point. In the first case, your friend doesn\u0026rsquo;t make any reference to mental illness at all and uses the framing of \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rsquo;re not dealing with your problems well.\u0026rdquo; In modern society this might be considered borderline gaslighting, but the upside of victim-blaming is that it gives the victim all the agency. In being sort of brutal towards you, your friend is also attributing agency to you and giving you concrete options towards recovery. In the second case, your friend is being much nicer and more sensitive to you and staying on your side, but their framing also implicitly suggests that there\u0026rsquo;s very little you can do about your problems. Altering your brain chemistry would maybe be helpful, but it\u0026rsquo;s too vague and abstract to be actionable. Meanwhile, altering the trajectory of world events is too hard and unlikely to succeed. Making an appointment with a psychiatrist is by far the best idea your friend has in the second case (as the only actionable item), but it\u0026rsquo;s high-variance. The psychiatrist might write you a subscription for an SSRI and send you on your way, or they might even decide there\u0026rsquo;s actually nothing wrong.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s the case for not reifying mental illness. On the other hand, what if you actually have BPD and this is a depressive episode? BPD is difficult and dangerous to address purely through lifestyle interventions, you should definitely not try to do that without a doctor\u0026rsquo;s supervision.\nMy point, then, isn\u0026rsquo;t that you should never reify mental illness! Instead, I\u0026rsquo;m bringing this up here because I think Bures fails to take seriously a point that he himself makes: the fact that a mental illness is culturally contingent doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that it isn\u0026rsquo;t real. On the other hand, the fact that something is a real problem doesn\u0026rsquo;t make \u0026ldquo;mental illness\u0026rdquo; any less of a completely imaginary category that we\u0026rsquo;ve stuffed a huge variety of phenomena into. The common thread of interacting successfully with mental illness seems to be understanding specifically what is happening - which includes noticing how it interacts with cultural elements - and treating the actual thing that\u0026rsquo;s happening. One example of this can be found in Johann Harl\u0026rsquo;s TED talk on depression - I\u0026rsquo;ve paraphrased here:\nAn American doctor named David Sommerfield went to Cambodia to promote the antidepressant drug Paxil, but when he got there the Cambodian doctors explained that they didn’t need it because they already had a treatment for depression. Dr. Sommerfield was intrigued by the possibility of a new, herbal treatment for depression. Instead, locals told him about a rice paddy farmer who had lost his leg to an undetonated American land mine left over from the Vietnam war. Working in a rice paddy with the prosthetic leg was painful, and the patient had PTSD and was terrified of losing his other leg in another explosion. His situation became so bad that he stayed in bed crying with depressive symptoms. This sounded like a difficult case to treat, so Dr. Sommerfield asked the doctors how they treated the patient’s depressive symptoms. The Cambodian doctors explained that they simply bought the patient a cow. The man couldn\u0026rsquo;t be a rice paddy farmer anymore, so his community pooled their money and bought him a dairy cow, which presumably acted as a combination service animal and source of income. The man, according to the Cambodian doctors, recovered within a month.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s missing from the above story is a diagnosis of depression. The farmer\u0026rsquo;s mental condition wasn\u0026rsquo;t taken as a category of thing that was happening purely in his brain, it was taken as a unique product of circumstance and response. In this case, it was harder to treat the farmer\u0026rsquo;s PTSD and (very reasonable) fear of losing another leg \u0026ldquo;in his head\u0026rdquo; (though talk therapy, medication, or similar) than it was to get him a cow, so they went with the cow option and it worked! This doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean that cows are good for treating mental illness (or depression), it means that it\u0026rsquo;s important to recognize how the concept of mental illness (or depression) itself can be limiting.\nAnd so, to return to my original question of how much mental illness should be reified, my cowardly answer is that it should be reified as much as is appropriate given the context. Some things really are brain chemistry, as far as I can tell, and need very finely-balanced medication to resolve in the short-to-medium term. A lot of other things aren\u0026rsquo;t, and maybe framing those things in ways that deprive people of agency is doing more harm than good.\n* Replace bad guy of your choice if you want, but my new hot take is that even if there\u0026rsquo;s very little to be done about it and it makes more sense to critique liberal policies than to essentially scream into the void by critiquing conservatives, maybe it\u0026rsquo;s good from a purely discourse-shaping perspective to bring up the fact that Republicans want to destroy democracy every now and then\n"

                "body": "A brief introduction to Georgism\nIn 1930, John Meynard Keynes made two predictions about the present day in an essay called \u0026ldquo;Economic Possibilities For Our Grandchildren\u0026rdquo;. Productivity, he said, would have risen massively, leading to tremendous material wealth per capita. Keynes further anticipated that this would lead to a world where most people worked no more than a few hours a day and devoted the rest of their lives to art, poetry, and the like. Obviously, Keynes\u0026rsquo; second prediction was wrong - Americans work a couple hours a day less, on average, than they did in his time, but we\u0026rsquo;re nowhere close to the 3-4 hours a day he envisioned (his exact prediction was 15 hours a week). In fact, I suspect that most of the decrease is accounted for by the fact that Keynes made his prediction before women entered the workplace (having two wage-earners in a marriage/couple means each individual should have to work half as much, so you\u0026rsquo;d expect a much larger decrease than we actually got). But Keynes\u0026rsquo; first prediction was also wrong: though he didn\u0026rsquo;t assign any hard numbers, he suggests an 8x productivity improvement as plausible. Between 1930 and 2019, the US population roughly tripled. But the US inflation-adjusted GDP grew by more than 225x, meaning that Keynes dramatically underestimated productivity growth (as measured by GDP per capita).\nKeynes was widely acknowledged to be brilliant, but the fact that these closely related predictions were both dramatically wrong in different directions indicates that there was something wrong with his world model. But there was another economist who, 50 years before Keynes\u0026rsquo; predictions, wrote a book that correctly predicts and explains why software engineers living in San Francisco making $100,000 a year are living on the poverty line. His name was Henry George, and I did not read his book.\nInstead, I read Lars Doucet\u0026rsquo;s excellent ACX review, which was fantastic if a little long, so I\u0026rsquo;ve condensed it down here. Happy reading!\nComplaints There are a bunch of things going wrong in society for no obvious reason. For example:\nRent is high relative to real income and getting higher Important inputs to societal growth (education, healthcare, childcare) are getting more expensive faster than average hourly income is growing George claims that that these problems are actually endogenous features of capitalist society. Here\u0026rsquo;s a particularly prescient quote from his book, Progress and Poverty:\nIf there is less deep poverty in San Fran Francisco than in New York, is it not because San Francisco is yet behind New York in all that both cities are striving for? When San Francisco reaches the point where New York now is, who can doubt that there will also be ragged and barefooted children on her streets?\nTerminology George introduces a number of terms that he uses in very specific ways. Among them:\nWealth - George claims that wealth can only take the form of concrete goods which have value and require labor to produce. Money, therefore, is not wealth so much as a claim on wealth (cf: Debt - The First 5000 Years). Stocks, bonds, and slaves are likewise not wealth. Essentially, wealth is accumulated real value. Printing more money or stocks, or enslaving people, doesn\u0026rsquo;t create value and therefore isn\u0026rsquo;t wealth. George would probably claim that an ebook is wealth, but the right to read an ebook isn\u0026rsquo;t. Capital is wealth intended to create more wealth. George suggests that a worker\u0026rsquo;s bread is not capital, because the worker would need to eat regardless of his employment status, but that his steel-toed boots are, because they are intended specifically to help him with his work. Land is anything \u0026ldquo;freely supplied by nature\u0026rdquo; and is the source of all wealth, but is not itself wealth. For example, the fish in the sea, orbital real estate, and the EM spectrum are all \u0026ldquo;land\u0026rdquo; Rent is the money you make by owning land Wages are the money you make by selling your labor Interest is the money you make by investing capital and realizing returns on your investment One more term, related to the Georgist concept of rent, is economic rent, which is any payment to an owner or factor of production in excess of the costs incurred in its creation. Since, in George\u0026rsquo;s view, land is \u0026ldquo;freely supplied by nature\u0026rdquo; and therefore costs nothing to create, all land rent is also economic rent.\nWhy Do Wages not Grow with GDP? Imagine 3 plots of land, which we\u0026rsquo;ll call A, B, and C. They have the following characteristics:\nPlot A is owned by me and I won\u0026rsquo;t let you work it if you don\u0026rsquo;t pay me. But it\u0026rsquo;s high-quality arable land and would let you produce $100 in value. Plot B is just as good as plot A (you can produce $100 by working it) and is also a common. Plot C is also a common, but it\u0026rsquo;s crappy land that would only yield $10. Clearly, you should choose to farm plot B. Or, to put it another way, I can\u0026rsquo;t afford to charge you for access to plot A. But if I find some way to stop you from using plot B, then I can charge up to $89 in rent on plot A! In other words, rent allows me to eat the margin of production between my land and the most productive/profitable alternative to its use (note: Lars\u0026rsquo; review says it\u0026rsquo;s the least productive alternative, but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to me). If both lot A and lot B are owned, there\u0026rsquo;s also no incentive for you to improve the soil in either lot and thereby increase its productivity, as your landlord will simply raise the rent to match the margin of production.\nWages don\u0026rsquo;t grow with GDP because of that thought experiment. Land is an input to all wealth production. If all land is owned, then the landowners can set rents high enough to effectively force subsistence wages, capturing most profit from improvements for themselves. If wages aren\u0026rsquo;t growing with GDP, this indicates that a large fraction of land is owned and it\u0026rsquo;s hard to find low-hanging fruit (\u0026ldquo;natural opportunity\u0026rdquo;) that someone isn\u0026rsquo;t already charging rent for.\nBut there are other reasons too! Landowners get more powerful as society grows, for two main reasons. First, a larger society experiences benefits from specialization and the margin of production (the values of the least valuable land that\u0026rsquo;s still worth using) goes down, so demand for land is increased. Second, developing technology brings out the latent value of land. For example, land rich with iron ore is worthless unless you have the technology to smelt iron and industries that demand it.\nLand Speculation When you expect something to rise in value, you buy and hold it. Since there\u0026rsquo;s a finite amount of land, holding it and not improving it can work in your favor. If you buy a vacant lot in the middle of a city and just hold onto it, you\u0026rsquo;re still forcing people who otherwise could have used the lot to go buy property somewhere else. These people, of course, are buying at the margin of production and therefore pushing it down. Since the amount of rent you can extract from your land is the value of the wealth someone else can get from it minus the margin of production, holding the land without developing it has increased its value.\nGeorge claims that (all?) economic boom/bust cycles are caused by land speculation. His reasoning is that land speculators, perhaps making imprudent investments/decisions, sometimes drive the margin of production so low that production is slowed or stopped. At this point, you get a bust until land prices come down or (more usually) technology improves enough that increased productivity allows labor and capital to produce returns. This explains why you sometimes see an abundance of labor and capital, but no generation of wealth.\nGeorge gives an example of the reign of Henry VIII, who seized common lands and gave them to aristocrats. Since the number of farm workers didn\u0026rsquo;t change and a ton of employers entered the market, traditional economics should lead you to expect wages to go up due to the increase in demand. Instead, they went down, because there were no productive alternatives to renting farmland.\nProposed Solution George proposes that land ownership should be taxed according to (and perhaps at) the land\u0026rsquo;s inherent value. He believes that everyone is entitled to the products of their labor, which often includes improvements on the land, but that no one is entitled to deny others the products of nature. George, therefore, is not averse to private property! He thinks that everyone is entitled to the products of/returns on their labor. Since labor is impossible without land, land ownership is really denying others the ability to labor and is therefore actually bad for creating private property.\nSo is \u0026ldquo;landlord\u0026rdquo; just not a job then? Aren\u0026rsquo;t apartments and high-density housing, like, a good thing? They are a good thing! Being a landlord is totally a job, and landlords\u0026rsquo; income reflects this: it is composed not only of the rent they collect on their ability to deny others access to natural resources, but also of the wages they earn maintaining their property and the interest they make on the capital they expended to create and improve their units! George objects only to the rent, which charges other people to access the community/area around the apartment building. This is value which the landlord didn\u0026rsquo;t produce and shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to collect on.\nLand Value Tax Land Value Tax (LVT) is not property tax! Property tax taxes both land and improvements to the land. LVT only taxes based on the \u0026ldquo;ground rent\u0026rdquo;, which is the value of the unimproved land. LVT captures the \u0026ldquo;leakage\u0026rdquo; from improvements to an area that a landlord would otherwise be able to freeload on. So, for example, the unimproved land in New York City is worth more than a patch of swamp somewhere. There are improvements you can make to land which become indistinguishable from land (example: improving the soil quality of farmland); George says we just have to accept that these improvements will be incorporated into the land value when computing the tax.\nGeorge thinks the LVT should be assessed at 100%, but modern Georgists tend to say something closer to 85%. This should decrease the cost of real estate, because land speculation becomes extremely unprofitable under an LVT, so some land previously held out of supply by speculators can be sold. Simultaneously, speculators exit the market on the demand side, so supply of available land rises and demand for land falls (except in places where LVT results in an economic boom).\nGeorge advocates using the LVT to eliminate other taxes and possibly establish a UBI, which obviously raises a question:\nHow Much Money Could LVT Raise? You might expect that as labor+capital become immensely more productive at creating wealth from land, land value becomes low relative to the size of the economy and LVT can\u0026rsquo;t raise much money. On the other hand, that would cause more and more value to leak into the land, so maybe land stays pretty sizeable? Let\u0026rsquo;s see! It turns out that if we estimate just the land rent, it would probably cover the entire US defense budget, or social security. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot!\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also the fact that a lot of welfare spending provides benefits which are soaked up by the land, which increases the amount of taxes that can be collected. Joseph Stigliz suggests that for pure (non-rival, non-excludable) public goods, the entire value is soaked up by the land and that therefore LVT can fund all improvements forever.\nWouldn\u0026rsquo;t LVT Raise Rents? You might think that, but no! Traditional economics doesn\u0026rsquo;t even predict that this would happen, because the supply of land is constant, meaning that landowners can\u0026rsquo;t produce less land in response to price signals. To illustrate: let\u0026rsquo;s say I\u0026rsquo;m a landlord with a bunch of apartments. I\u0026rsquo;m currently charging the maximum amount of rent that I can get away with charging; I know this because I actually don\u0026rsquo;t have full utilization of my units (some low percentage aren\u0026rsquo;t being rented out because they\u0026rsquo;re too expensive and tenants prefer to live elsewhere). Now an LVT is instituted and my costs go up. Can I pass those costs on to new tenants by raising rents? Probably not! I was already charging as much as I could, and tenants still have all the same alternatives they had before. If I raise rents, tenants will rent from someone else instead and my utilization rates will fall. Maybe if I collaborated with every landlord in some large area we could illegally collude in raising our prices, but this is pretty unlikely to happen in practice, I hope.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also a more Georgist way to look at this: as a landlord, I\u0026rsquo;m already charging the margin of production as rent. But LVT doesn\u0026rsquo;t change the margin of production - in fact, it maybe reduces it by freeing up land held by specultors! I can\u0026rsquo;t charge more, or people will exercise their alternatives, so I\u0026rsquo;m forced to keep charging the same rent (or less, if the margin has decreased).\nHas Anyone Tried This? Yes! A few Nordic countries have LVTs, and the Danish government accidentally ran a cool experiment on them. And mostly they found that LVTs work more or less as Georgists claim they should.\nClosing Notes Whether you agree with the LVT or not, Georgism seems to have been impressively predictive of the dynamics it tries to deal with. One nice thing in favor of LVT is that it taxes something we actually want less of: profiting off of your ability to withold unearned, finite natural resources from people who would use them to benefit society. This is as opposed to a lot of other taxes, like VAT (taxes value, value is the best, and it\u0026rsquo;s also regressive which isn\u0026rsquo;t awesome), property tax (taxes improvements to land, only good if you want to slow down your society for some reason), or income tax (income is wonderful and I only wish I had some).

                "body": "I just read a lot about mattresses and now I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell you about it.\nI recently spent a long time learning about mattresses in order to buy myself one, and I learned a lot! If you have zero interest in this and just want to know what mattress I got, I purchased an IKEA Haugesund on sale for $250, for specific reasons that probably don\u0026rsquo;t apply to you (I may be moving in the next year or two and don\u0026rsquo;t know if I\u0026rsquo;ll be taking my mattress with me, so I really want the cheapest mattress that I think will be reasonably good without regard to durability). To prepare for my mattress-buying quest, I read every page in the John Ryan by Design Understanding Beds series. This took\u0026hellip; a while, and I want to save both of us the trouble of doing that (or, in my case, doing it again). So this is sort of a book review, I guess.\nnb: the JRBD website does have a number of helpful tables scattered around it showing, for example, what different upholstery materials can be expected to feel like, how many pocket springs you should expect at different price points, and appropriate spring gauges for different weights. None of these tables have been reproduced here, so you\u0026rsquo;ll have to look for them on the original site.\nCan\u0026rsquo;t I Just Get One That Feels Good Though No. That would be ideal, but getting mattresses purely by feel has the drawback that you\u0026rsquo;re usually buying the mattress based on how it feels to lie down on it for 2-5 minutes, but the actual quality of the mattress is how it performs over years of sleeping on it 8 hours a night. There are also multiple factors that affect the feel of the mattress, and only some of them should be chosen by feel. So you have to learn about mattresses.\nWhat You Want a Mattress to Do This section is more based on my understanding than anything I read, take it with a grain of salt. But I think there are a few things that a good mattress does:\nCushion your body by distributing the pressure of your weight as evenly as possible (in other words, be comfortable) Provide support to keep your body in a sustainable and comfortable postion/alignment (this is called supportiveness) Allow you to move around and shift position in your sleep, working with your natural techniques for staying comfortable through the night (this is called responsiveness) Help keep you cool, if you have any problems with that at all (your blankets should be largely responsible for keeping you warm) Last for a long time Miscellaneous: look good, not make you sick, ideally not be super heavy, etc, etc Is it Worth It? Should you even try to get a really good mattress? It seems like there would be two obvious reasons which, if they were supported by research, should be convincing: sleep quality and long-term joint health (especially back health). Unfortunately, all the studies I\u0026rsquo;ve looked at seem to be pretty low-quality and I don\u0026rsquo;t really trust them - especially because many of them start from the assumption that one level of firmness will work best for everyone, which is so obviously unsupported by even a cursory look at how people actually sleep in real life that I find it a little hard to believe it was even published.\nSleep quality seems to be intuitively supported by a good mattress, to the point that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t even really make sense to accept that some mattresses are better than others if you don\u0026rsquo;t believe they have an impact on how you sleep on them (except maybe you\u0026rsquo;d want the most durable mattress, which would mean you should sleep on the floor, since nothing lasts longer than anything).\nPeople who already have back pain often say that finding a good mattress makes a huge difference in their ability to function day-to-day, but what if you don\u0026rsquo;t have back pain and want to avoid it? Should you spend time and money optimizing your bed? I can\u0026rsquo;t say definitively because the studies are once again all very shitty. But it again makes intuitive sense to me that at it would at least be possible to make a really bad mattress for back health. That doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee that it\u0026rsquo;s possible to meaningfully improve over the average (or at least, past some given point which might be well short of the most expensive options), but considering my expectations of a high-quality mattress (let\u0026rsquo;s say it costs $3k and lasts 25 years), the amortized cost seems like a pretty modest investment in your health (about 30 cents a day, making it much cheaper than most supplements and almost at parity with air filters when you consider that they need to be replaced once or twice a year).\nMattress Types There are three main types of mattress that most people will be looking at and are any good at all: foam, traditional/pocket spring, and hybrid mattresses. Of these, I think pocket sprung mattresses are the best for most people (disclaimer: this is also what John Ryan by Design wants me to think - I\u0026rsquo;ve been thorougly convinced).\nFoam mattresses are\u0026hellip; well, made out of foam. Usually they give the sensation of sinking into them, and it\u0026rsquo;s often hard to shift positions in a foam mattress even after just a minute of laying there because you\u0026rsquo;ve created a little ditch that you naturally settle into. In mattress industry lingo, this is low responsiveness, and for me it means that I find it harder to move around at night to relieve stress on particular parts of my body. Foam mattresses are usually uncomfortable for me after a few hours. Also, foam mattresses usually retain much more heat than pocket sprung mattresses. These are rules of thumb - there are some really rigid foams, so I\u0026rsquo;d imagine that maybe some foam beds are quite supportive and maybe even responsive. But my (limited) experience is that this tends to be the exception rather than the rule, even with very high-end foam mattresses. Most of the mattresses-in-a-box are foam.\nAlmost all mattresses have multiple layers, and pocket sprung mattresses have a layer of steel springs which are individually wrapped in fabric, which apparently helps them compress independently of one another to conform well to your body. I don\u0026rsquo;t know why this would work well, but I can confirm that they are much more comfortable than \u0026ldquo;open cage\u0026rdquo; mattresses where the springs aren\u0026rsquo;t isolated this way. On top of the springs are several layers of upholstery filling material, also called \u0026ldquo;comfort layers.\u0026rdquo; Sometimes one or more of these comfort layers will be made of foam, but they\u0026rsquo;re more typically fibers of some kind - either synthetic (like polyester) or natural (like wool). Pocket sprung mattresses tend to be better-ventilated, more responsive, and more supportive than foam mattresses.\nHybrid mattresses are basically a foam mattress on top of some pocket springs. This is supposed to solve a lot of the issues with foam but maybe still be cheaper to manufacture or something? This would sort of make sense, in that you don\u0026rsquo;t need to deal with fibrous upholstery, which is probably harder to work with than laminated sheets of foam.\nThe tl;dr here is that a good mattress will probably be pocket sprung, but pocket sprung mattresses don\u0026rsquo;t have to be expensive. My $250 IKEA mattress is also pocket sprung. The rest of this post is pretty specific to pocket sprung mattresses.\nYou should probably be careful about buying types of mattress that aren\u0026rsquo;t one of these three.\nFirst Steps The first thing you need to do when you\u0026rsquo;re buying a pocket-sprung mattress is to figure out the right spring tension. This is because the spring tension should not be determined by feel! Instead, you should use your weight. If you weigh under about 100 lbs, you might want a \u0026lsquo;soft\u0026rsquo; spring tension. The tension corresponds to the diameter of the spring wire, so a soft tension corresponds to a 1.2mm wire. Between 100 and 225 lbs, you want a \u0026lsquo;medium\u0026rsquo; tension (1.4mm), and between 225 and 280 lbs you\u0026rsquo;re looking for \u0026lsquo;firm\u0026rsquo; (1.6mm). Above 280 lbs, you can use \u0026rsquo;extra firm\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;orthopedic\u0026rsquo; tensions (1.9mm).\nnb: I think there\u0026rsquo;s also a height component that might affect unusually tall or short people. Apparently the JRBD people are willing to talk with you about it for free - probably worth it for such a big purchase\nSo if you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be using feel to determine spring tension, how do you get a mattress that feels good? This should be done entirely with the upholstery! Denser upholstery with less loft will feel firmer.\nMattress Attributes {One, two}-sided: this is mostly important if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for durability and are willing to do a little work to get it. Two-sided mattresses can and should be flipped every month or so, but will apparently last longer if you remember to do this. Otherwise they\u0026rsquo;ll last as long as a one-sided mattress. However, one-sided mattresses are cheaper to make, so if you can get them for cheaper and you\u0026rsquo;re not willing to flip a mattress every month you might as well save money. If you get a one-sided mattress, you can get a mattress topper too, which might improve the longevity some. GSM: This is an attribute of the upholstery and stands for grams per square meter - it measures the mass of upholstery in a 1 square meter cross section of the mattress. Spring count: This is the total number of pocket springs in the mattress. But you have to watch out, because manufacturers will add \u0026ldquo;micro-springs\u0026rdquo; that don\u0026rsquo;t provide support to inflate the count. Reasonable counts are between 800 (for a medium-low-end mattress) and 2000 (high-end mattress) for a queen size bed. If you see something like 6000, the count is definitely inflated. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically make the mattress bad! It just means that they\u0026rsquo;re manipulating a commonly-used statistic for marketing purposes, which is a thing that even a good mattress might theoretically have to do just to stay in the game. Upholstery material: different materials feel different, and have different thermal properties. You might prefer natural materials over synthetic ones. Edge support: this isn\u0026rsquo;t a spec you can really look up, but it\u0026rsquo;s worth paying attention to. Does the mattress sag more at the edges so you fall off if you don\u0026rsquo;t sleep near the center? Ticking: the fabric on top of your mattress. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is too important, except that some mattresses use a bonded fabric for some reason? Which is really impermeable to air and water and an obviously bad material. Consumer Reports Consumer Reports is not good at reviewing mattresses. Also, Tempur-pedic is bad and overpriced. There, I said it.\nBuying a Mattress If you want a wish list for a pretty nice mattress that won\u0026rsquo;t be horrendously expensive, I\u0026rsquo;d look at the JRBD Origins Pocket 1500 as a guideline (note: JRBD doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually ship to the US, unfortunately). Starting from the top of the mattress and going down, it has:\nA woven ticking A top layer of natural fiber upholstery (feels nicer than synthetic) Several layers of synthetic fibers (provides cost savings over all natural), to total 1050 GSM fiber upholstery A polyester pad for another 500 GSM upholstery material (I personally don\u0026rsquo;t think this should be added to the total on their website but whatever) A foam pad 1500 pocket springs Everything except for the pocket springs in reverse order, to make this a double-sided mattress This costs £760, or $900, for a double bed (JRBD doesn\u0026rsquo;t sell queen beds). That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of money, but really cheap for a quality mattress - and based purely on the description and reviews, this is a really good mattress.\nRelatively speaking, I got a very mediocre mattress, but I got a bigger bed for $250. For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, I do think IKEA delivers really good value for money on inexpensive mattresses, but when you get to the $600 and up level - which is really where you start to see even reasonably good mattresses - I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably better to go somewhere else.\nThat said, my mattress has 700 pocket springs under two layers of polyurethane foam and two layers of polyester and viscose wadding. This isn\u0026rsquo;t terrible - I lose about half of the pocket springs and a lot of the upholstery quality (I didn\u0026rsquo;t even know PU foam was a thing). Also, the mattress is one-sided and so less durable. But I save about $650, and I don\u0026rsquo;t have to feel bad about getting rid of this mattress when the time comes. Also I think I can get a mattress topper made of natural fibers that I can perhaps reuse on my next mattress for $200, which makes up for some of the gap while still saving me $450 and allowing me to remain flexible.\nSo do the cost/benefit analysis for yourself and find something you like! Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to actually lay on mattresses!\n"

                "body": "Ideally, you would want to cook with things that won\u0026rsquo;t give you cancer or make you sick. How are we doing on that?\nNonstick Pans There are, as far as I can tell, only two ways to make pans that don\u0026rsquo;t stick to food, and both are coatings. The first, and most common, kind of coating is called PTFE. The most common brand of nonstick PTFE coating is Teflon, but most nonstick pans are made with this stuff. If your pan uses \u0026ldquo;Quantanium\u0026rdquo; (Cuisinart) or \u0026ldquo;Titanium\u0026rdquo; (T-fal) nonstick, even though they never actually say they\u0026rsquo;re using PTFE, the actual coating is PTFE. I emphasize this because I thought I\u0026rsquo;d been careful not to get PTFE-coated pans before, and then realized that I\u0026rsquo;d fallen for the insanely deceptive marketing around this space. Both of the companies I mentioned try really hard not to say what\u0026rsquo;s actually in their nonstick coatings.\nThis is sort of weird, because T-fal seems very confident that PTFE coatings are safe: they claim that their PTFE-based coating is \u0026ldquo;non-toxic even when ingested\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;certified to be harmless by public health bodies in Europe and in the US,\u0026rdquo; though they seem to be very coy about what public health bodies they\u0026rsquo;re talking about. I, and I cannot emphasize this enough, have zero expertise that qualifies me in any way to give medical advice, but I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to avoid PTFE for the time being anyway.\nPTFE PTFE nonstick coatings have been around since the 40s, when Teflon was introduced by DuPont. PTFE was manufactured using a chemical called PFOA (Perfluorooctanoic Acid), which falls under a family of chemicals called PFAS (Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances).\nDuPont discovered that PFAS were toxic in the 1960s, and that PFOA specifically was toxic in the 1970s. However, when the Toxic Substances Control Act was passed in 1976 to regulate the manufacture and sale of chemicals, PFOA was grandfathered in without being reviewed, despite the fact that 3M had recently discovered that PFAS bioaccumulate in humans. By the 90s, it was pretty clear that PFOA was carcinogenic. In the early and mid 2000s, various companies voluntarily started phasing out PFOA and replacing it with other PFAS, notably one called GenX. The main strength of GenX over PFOA doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to be that anyone has proven its safety - it\u0026rsquo;s just that it hasn\u0026rsquo;t been studied enough to prove that it\u0026rsquo;s dangerous.\nBut things don\u0026rsquo;t look good for PTFE cookware from my perspective: Sajid et. al. (2017) point out that \u0026ldquo;at normal cooking temperatures, PTFE-coated cookware releases various gases and chemicals that present mild to severe toxicity,\u0026rdquo; and you only have to look at a PTFE-coated pan that\u0026rsquo;s seen a few years of use (even careful use) to see that some of the coating has chipped off, presumably into your food. On a completely unscientific and personal note, I don\u0026rsquo;t like it when companies try to trick me into buying their products, especially when they do that by naming one material (PTFE) after another material (titanium). I honestly can\u0026rsquo;t believe this is legal. So, what are the alternatives?\nStainless Steel Stainless steel is a pretty compelling alternative! It\u0026rsquo;s been around for a long time, and unlike aluminum, copper, and carbon steel, it\u0026rsquo;s nonreactive with food, so you won\u0026rsquo;t end up with metal ions in your tomato sauce. It\u0026rsquo;s also self-healing in that the nonreactive coating is an oxide layer that will re-oxidize if the material gets scratched. The biggest problem with it is that it\u0026rsquo;s not actually nonstick - it will stick to delicate stuff like eggs, especially in high temperatures.\nEdit 2023/01/04 - Alloys The stainless steel alloy matters! I\u0026rsquo;ve seen some people claiming that nickel content in stainless steel is bad, but nickel is actually added to stainless steel specifically to prevent leeching, especially in the presence of acids and other corrosives. You\u0026rsquo;ll see a few alloys of stainless steel used in cookware, including 304, 316, and 430. Of these, 316 is the most resistant to corrosion. However, 430 stainless steel is a ferritic alloy while 316 isn\u0026rsquo;t (meaning that 430 is magnetic and will work with induction stovetops). This study looked at grade-316 stainless steel specifically and found that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t enough leeching even to be a risk to people with nickel sensitivities. For that reason, I\u0026rsquo;d recommend 316 specifically.\nCeramic Coatings Ceramic coatings are usually made of silicon dioxide, which is just standard glass. They are safe up to higher temperatures than PTFE (ceramic coatings are safe up to 800F, so there\u0026rsquo;s basically zero risk there) and are also highly inert. I haven\u0026rsquo;t found anything suggesting they\u0026rsquo;re not safe, but that seems to be because they\u0026rsquo;re not very well-studied. That said, they do pass the heuristic check of being made of a pretty well-understood material. The one problem with ceramic coatings is that they don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be as durable as PTFE - it\u0026rsquo;s important to use only wood or plastic utensils with them, and you should hand-wash them to avoid wear and tear from the dishwasher. Even with these precautions, you\u0026rsquo;ll be replacing ceramic-coated pans every couple of years - and you need to be careful that the core material (the metal under the coating) isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be too harmful if you cook with a chipped pan for a couple of months.\nMy Take I like to cook, but I\u0026rsquo;m not super passionate about it. I want stuff that will work well and not be annoying, and also hopefully be reasonably cost-effective. For me, it seems like the best way to make that happen is to use mostly stainless steel cookware, with a couple of ceramic coated pans for stuff like eggs. Unfortunately, the least durable parts of this system will probably see the most use, but options for true nonstick seem to be limited to one that might give me cancer and/or endocrine issues and one that probably won\u0026rsquo;t but isn\u0026rsquo;t durable. So I\u0026rsquo;m doing the non-cancer one.\nnb: other materials. There are a lot of other materials not mentioned here that might be good for people with different priorities than me, including copper, aluminum, carbon steel, and cast iron. All of these materials will react with acidic foods and leech metal ions into them, which makes them ineligible for consideration for me because that\u0026rsquo;s not something I want to think about. As with everything on this blog, you should do your own research and find something that works for you!!\n"

                "body": "Oh god here it goes I\u0026rsquo;m doing the education one\nI was, in many senses, extraordinarily lucky in my education. The public schools I attended through the end of high school were very probably in the top 1% in the US; I\u0026rsquo;d estimate that my education cost the school system well over $15,000 per year. Something like 95% of my high school graduating class went on to attend college, a cohort which included myself. My undergraduate and graduate education were completed at one of the best schools in the country for my field. And, like a lot of people in my position, I think the school system is pretty awful.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s worth considering that I might be wrong about this. I did well in college and even better in grad school, and I have every reason to believe that I\u0026rsquo;ll be professionally successful too. By some measures, I\u0026rsquo;m already a success story for the system. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think my success, such as it is, is attributable to the system - or, in fact, actually a success. In this essay, I want to talk about school: what makes it good or bad, where we are now, and where I think we should be.\nWhat is School For? The school system (I would guess) considers my education a success; I don\u0026rsquo;t. This comes down to a difference in opinion on how success should be defined - in other words, what school is for. In my view, there are two kinds of school, the kind that everybody gets and the kind that not everybody gets, and they have different (and extremely broad) purposes.\nSchool Everyone Gets The kind of school that everybody gets is specifically for young people and should have a few goals:\nTake care of children during the day so their parents don\u0026rsquo;t have to Transmit general culture Teach \u0026ldquo;survival skills\u0026rdquo; like reading, writing, social fluency, and basic math Provide access to an emotionally nourishing and safe environment where students are free to explore and develop as people Help students establish suitable career paths/exit trajectories I think most of the problems with primary and secondary education are that they try too hard to teach while providing almost no mentorship and optimizing for specific exit trajectories. The purpose of primary education has, for around a hundred years, been to prepare children for work in an industrial society. Children are taught to sit still, be quiet, and deal with their boredom non-disruptively because these are essential skills for industrial workers. Secondary education, meanwhile, is differently tuned in different places - some schools, like mine, assume that everyone is going to college and doing specialized knowledge work, while others assume that everyone is going to work in a factory or the gig economy. Both of these assumptions are pretty dumb. People who are going to work a trade shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have their time wasted by pointless academics, and people with unusually high abstract reasoning abilities shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be funneled into driving for Uber or something.\nSchool Not Everyone Gets The kind of school that not everybody gets (which, in the US, is typically college, though trade school also counts here) has two further goals:\nIndoctrinate people into specific subcultures (to include meeting other students and more established experts in their fields of study) Prepare people for specific jobs and, potentially, social roles The failure point here, I think, is that some colleges and universities either don\u0026rsquo;t understand what they\u0026rsquo;re for or aren\u0026rsquo;t incentivized to do their jobs. However, of course, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of diversity here (a statement that I\u0026rsquo;m sure applies to primary and secondary education too, though this is of course a hard statement to put a number on).\nIn the time since it was founded in 1636, Harvard University has produced 8 US presidents, countless CEOs and executives, and influenced, for better or worse, a large fraction of the American elite. For more than 200 years, Harvard\u0026rsquo;s educational objectives were explicitly moral - they had a normative idea of how a man (Harvard admitted its first woman in 1920) ought to be and what he ought to know, and their education was inextricably bound up with moral development. And this is a very good thing! I want our CEOs and presidents to be good people! I want the people they spend time with and ask for advice to be good people! I also want all of these people to be smart and practical. And if someone is not a good person, I want them to have less access to power. Harvard should be an explicitly moral institution - and today, it seems to me that they aren\u0026rsquo;t and don\u0026rsquo;t want to be. It\u0026rsquo;s both easier and less controversial to cash in on your status as gatekeeper to the American elite than it is to execute that role faithfully.\nOptical engineering is one of the more underappreciated fields in the world of academia. Undergraduates and high schoolers typically don\u0026rsquo;t hear about it or consider it as an option, and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t get enough media attention to boost prestige or draw donors or grants. And so, the University of Arizona is one of the few schools in the US to have an excellent optical engineering program, despite the fact that optical engineers are absolutely essential to a number of critical manufacturing processes, including all semiconductor fabrication. Graduates of the University of Arizona optical engineering program can expect to be actively headhunted by companies that routinely reject MIT applicants, such as Intel and Nvidia - and this is especially impressive when you discover that students can expect this even when they only complete the two-year associate\u0026rsquo;s degree program. The University of Arizona, with its acceptance rate of 85%, can punch way outside of its weight division because it focuses on strictly relevant material and takes a highly practical approach to educating its students in an important field.\nHarvard stopped educating their students in classical literature (and many other areas) to instill moral virtue and I\u0026rsquo;ve criticized them for that, but I\u0026rsquo;d be dismayed to see the University of Arizona assign their students The Iliad. Why? Because Harvard is educating a generation of aristocrats and Arizona is educating a generation of engineers, and those roles are different. All else being equal, I\u0026rsquo;d want the optical engineers to be good people too, but it\u0026rsquo;s not vitally important to me.\nSome jobs don\u0026rsquo;t require any school, and this suggests that lots of school isn\u0026rsquo;t for everyone. I\u0026rsquo;d guess that society currently needs about 25-30% of people doing knowledge work and another 30-50% doing skilled labor (varies a lot depending on how it\u0026rsquo;s defined). If this is right, we currently have way too many people going to college (a quick Google search gave numbers between 40% and 60% of young people enrolled in college). On the other hand, we probably need more people doing skilled labor, especially if the US is ever going to recover its ability to manufacture anything.\nAlso: about 200 US colleges have programs for intellectually disabled students; I don\u0026rsquo;t think an ideal system would be set up this way. Many of these programs are actually good and helpful in that they focus on teaching life skills and social fluency with the goal that participants are able to function independently, but these programs are a worthwhile investment for society to make for everyone who needs them, while academics beyond what everyone gets are unlikely to be particularly useful to an intellectually disabled person. In other words, I would want to see these programs set up independently of colleges and made freely available to anyone who could benefit from them, without prohibitive tuitions. And I want this because I think it\u0026rsquo;s the morally right and nicest thing to do, but also because I think it\u0026rsquo;s good value for money to avoid having adults who are completely dependent on their parents, who might lose the ability to provide for them.\nHigher Education and Status Every year, thousands of students pursue undergraduate degrees in theater, English, journalism, and communications. There are intangible benefits that accrue to these students beyond the financial and practical, but it is indisputable that these students pay a lot of money for an education with a pretty low expected ROI. It\u0026rsquo;s incredibly rare to be able to support yourself as an author, journalist, or actor, which means that colleges are taking money - sometimes a lot of it - in exchange for a service that they know is likely to be worthless (and in fact of negative value, when you consider opportunity cost). Similarly, thousands of students drop out of school every year - some of them due to unforeseeable life events, but many of them due to very foreseeable financial stress, which they should have been warned about before they enrolled. These students are even worse off, as they don\u0026rsquo;t even get diplomas in exchange for the thousands (perhaps tens or even hundreds of thousands) of dollars they give to their schools. There are words for selling something worthless for a lot of money: scam, con, fraud, modern art (kidding!). The question is: why do people fall for it, and how do colleges keep getting away with it?\nI think the clear answer is status. Colleges aren\u0026rsquo;t, in fact, selling an education, or they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to get away with not teaching you anything useful. They aren\u0026rsquo;t selling earning potential, or they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to get away with abysmal ROIs. They are selling the status that comes with being college-educated. And you get more status for going to a better-known college. This is why US News and World Reports, which publishes college rankings in a number of categories each year, is so powerful: they substantially control public perception, and public perception is the product colleges are selling.\nThis creates a misalignment of incentives. Colleges are trying to maximize some joint function of profit and status (Malcom Gladwell has an absolutely insane interview with the president of Stanford, who tells him that there is no donation so large he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t accept it), but the best way to do this usually isn\u0026rsquo;t to effectively prepare people for their jobs and social roles. Harvard has the unusual problem that it\u0026rsquo;s no longer as socially acceptable to look too powerful or ambitious, so they have to teach people to go after money instead. Other colleges tend to have the reverse problem: they can get more prestige by wasting the time and money of their students under the guise of \u0026ldquo;teaching them to be well-rounded.\u0026rdquo; Naturally, they are never actually successful at this, because everyone involved knows that the college doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually care about how their students develop as human beings. This regression to some mean perception of what college in general should look like hurts everyone. Some college educations should look a lot more like trade school; others should look a lot more like the aristocratic education of the 1700s.\nStudents also value status; their incentives are not necessarily aligned with the best interests of society either. This is why we have way too many people in college: even though you\u0026rsquo;ll probably do much better financially and deliver more social value by becoming a plumber instead of an English major, plumbers are accorded less status, so the job market doesn\u0026rsquo;t allocate labor efficiently. I think Bernie Sanders\u0026rsquo; free-college-for-everyone scheme is a bad idea in that we don\u0026rsquo;t want or need everyone to be in college, but it resonates similarly for a lot of people to ideas like \u0026ldquo;everyone deserves respect.\u0026rdquo; The better solution here is to respect people even if they don\u0026rsquo;t go to college. But lots of people don\u0026rsquo;t do this, so we end up with many students feeling deeply betrayed by their college educations, even if they would never admit this to themselves. Sadly, these students don\u0026rsquo;t even get to keep what they paid for - most of the jobs we all called \u0026ldquo;essential\u0026rdquo; during the COVID pandemic are not high-status. Your barista at Starbucks can never admit, to you or to himself, that his degree in communications was a waste of $100,000 that will keep him trapped under a mountain of debt for decades, but there\u0026rsquo;s a good chance he is nonetheless incredibly angry at the entire system.\nTangent: Money, Power, and Culture In human history, it has generally been much more socially acceptable in most places to seek to accumulate power than it has been to seek to accumulate money/resources. In some ways this makes sense: it\u0026rsquo;s safer and easier to redistribute resources than to disperse power. The most notable exception in the ancient world was the city of Athens, which famously banished (ostracized) anyone who was becoming influential enough that they might threaten democracy. Given this, it\u0026rsquo;s sort of interesting to see that it\u0026rsquo;s currently more acceptable in the US to pursue money than power, even though this hasn\u0026rsquo;t always been the case. I\u0026rsquo;ve been frustrated for a long time that many of the brightest minds of our generation work in advertising and finance, but it also makes sense to me: you would have to be either extremely disagreeable or extremely ambitious in order for it to make sense for you to pursue power in today\u0026rsquo;s environment.\nThis is a cultural problem, and, as I\u0026rsquo;ve said, schools at all levels are institutions responsible for transmitting culture. I think what goes wrong here is a perhaps understandable desire for schools to present as value-free or apolitical. In some ways, this is a practical decision: if you take a stand on some particular value and some political group doesn\u0026rsquo;t like that, you become a target in the culture war. Also, taking a stand as an institution means you have to do work aligning your institution, so being value-free is in many ways the default. The problem is, there\u0026rsquo;s no such thing as \u0026ldquo;value-free\u0026rdquo; in that there\u0026rsquo;s always a default/dominant set of values that get adopted in absence of intervention. Those values might be different in different places, but I usually see many elements of neoliberalism in the default set, where people adopt the logic of markets and competition in their attitudes towards themselves and others. I don\u0026rsquo;t think this is particularly good; I would rather see almost any set of values explicitly promoted and offered for examination than neoliberalism unconsciously absorbed as the natural or only relationship you can have with yourself and the world.\nPrimary/Secondary Education, Unschooling, and How People Learn One thing you might have noticed in my list of purposes for school everyone gets is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve teaching. This isn\u0026rsquo;t because I think people can\u0026rsquo;t, don\u0026rsquo;t, or shouldn\u0026rsquo;t learn a lot when they\u0026rsquo;re young - just the opposite! I think most children are more capable than they\u0026rsquo;re given credit for, and traditional schools, as an artifact of their Industrial Age design, tend to unnecessarily play to children\u0026rsquo;s natural weaknesses instead of their strengths, making school an emotionally challenging environment that even adults usually find aversive. You probably have a lot more patience and self-control than a child; would you enjoy sitting through a day in elementary school? My list, then, is intended as a set of goals that I think should be common to all students. Especially in primary education, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure an agenda should be set beyond this one.\nIn How Children Learn, John Holt makes what I think is a very important objection to traditional schooling: if we set out to teach children based on our own agenda, what are we telling them about the things we try to teach? Children know that they learn on their own, because children spend most of their time learning things on their own. If we have to teach them something (let\u0026rsquo;s say, for example, reading), there must be some reason they can\u0026rsquo;t or won\u0026rsquo;t learn it in their own time. There are two possibilities:\nReading is inherently bad and not worth doing for its own sake, so we are forcing the child to read because they would never freely choose to do so The child is too stupid or immature to read on their own or recognize its importance So, it is natural for children to conclude, I am being forced to read either because reading is bad or because I am bad. And so on for almost everything. Children, as they so often tell us, want to do it themselves. And parents who choose to \u0026ldquo;unschool\u0026rdquo; their children (that is, non-coercively educate them, usually at home) report that they do, in fact, do it themselves. That isn\u0026rsquo;t to say that the children learn to read entirely without help, but they do invariably choose to seek help learning to read. If a child is raised to view herself as smart, capable, and agentic, it turns out she naturally wants to learn all of the things it\u0026rsquo;s really important for her to learn. It is only when we assume that she is stupid and lazy and act from that assumption that we are proven right. Fortunately, children are resilient and damage can usually be undone.\nA brief personal side note on this: when I was young, my parents signed me up for piano lessons, which I hated. My piano teacher barely lasted two weeks, and though I briefly taught myself to play a little in college, I never learned to play fluently. But I think this is because, despite the fact that I had a piano in my house, I never once saw my parents play it. Why should I have spent time learning something that no one around me seemed to think was worthwhile? At it turns out, I\u0026rsquo;m exactly the sort of person you\u0026rsquo;d expect to learn to play the piano, and at different points in my life I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to play a number of instruments purely for fun (though not terribly well). I think that if I grew up in an environment where people regularly played the piano for fun, I would have learned it enthusiastically.\nUnschooling isn\u0026rsquo;t the only right way to educate a child, and I think it\u0026rsquo;s very valid to point out that traditional schooling gives kids much more exposure to a diverse peer group. If you\u0026rsquo;re doing it alone, unschooling totally fails to accomplish the objective of taking the burden of childcare off of parents who may both need to work. But unschooling doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to be done alone! I think primary and secondary education would ideally much more closely resemble a learning cooperative than traditional school.\nLearning cooperatives partially incorporate a concept that dovetails nicely with self-directed/non-coercive learning: aristocratic tutoring (recently popularized by a Substack post by Erik Hoel). The tl;dr on Erik\u0026rsquo;s post is that aristocrats used to educate their children by essentially hiring graduate students to individually coach them in a diverse range of subjects; it wasn\u0026rsquo;t uncommon for an aristocratic child to have 10 or more tutors. Erik thinks that the disappearance of this practice is responsible for a decline in the number of exceptional thinkers relative to the past. I happen to think he\u0026rsquo;s wrong about the second part, but the first part is very intriguing. Like I said earlier, we have a ridiculous surplus of college-educated people. I have to think a lot of them would much rather tutor than wait tables; hire your kid a grad student! Not to prepare them for tests or anything, just to talk about whatever your kid thinks is cool.\nTangent: Test Scores I feel like I hear about average test scores a lot. There\u0026rsquo;s an average test score gap between the US and [insert Asian country here] and that\u0026rsquo;s a BIG PROBLEM that needs to be fixed RIGHT NOW. Except\u0026hellip; it isn\u0026rsquo;t? Average score is such a terrible metric when the skills that allow you to be good at, for example, standardized math tests are completely irrelevant to 60% or more of your population. John Holt has another amusing point in How Children Learn: when was the last time in your day-to-day life that you divided one fraction by another fraction?\nEven test scores for individuals aren\u0026rsquo;t really that good for the things they\u0026rsquo;re used for: maybe it makes to track progress with individual test scores, but scores capture way to much confounding information to compare people with each other. With that said, though, I do understand the argument for standardized tests in the college admissions process, in that standardized test scores are some of the best datapoints in the incredibly low-quality dataset available to colleges. Most of the more \u0026ldquo;holistic\u0026rdquo; criteria are hopelessly skewed towards wealthy students.\nConclusion and Practicalities If I have a child, my first choice for primary and secondary school would probably be to give them the option to choose between a learning cooperative and traditional school. If a learning cooperative wasn\u0026rsquo;t an option, I would hope to be able to sort of roll my own by collaborating with 10-20 other families in my area (assuming my child preferred that over traditional school).\nI think that in some disciplines, college isn\u0026rsquo;t as important as practical experience and it\u0026rsquo;s probably worth going to an easier/cheaper/less prestigious college so you can get the piece of paper HR departments look for while you do actually relevant things on the side. But this also isn\u0026rsquo;t always the case - for example, Yale Law and Harvard Business School really are the best law and business schools, not because they teach you law and business really well, but because law (some types in particular) and business rely on building social networks and Harvard and Yale attract people you want to have in your social networks. There are also plausibly some fields (maybe chemical engineering?) where self-study is really hard and high-quality mentorship is really important. So I would encourage my child to figure out what kind of field they\u0026rsquo;re in and make their decisions based on relevant signal rather than marketing materials (written by people who don\u0026rsquo;t know what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about) or US News and World Report (written by people who don\u0026rsquo;t know what they\u0026rsquo;re talking about and also probably extremely Goodharted at this point, even though they\u0026rsquo;re smart enough to keep their scoring algorithm secret).\nBasically, my conclusion is that the entire educational system is a mess of misaligned incentives and unclear goals. I think people should take their kids seriously and be fair towards them and try to avoid making them feel like they have to earn approval or affection. I think the middle class has been pretty effectively duped into competing for status that won\u0026rsquo;t help them. But also, I think that if you start by being clear about what you want and what you\u0026rsquo;re going to avoid, there are pretty good ways forward, and things will probably work out OK! I\u0026rsquo;d hope that in a hundred years, people will look back on modern schools a lot like we look at schools of the 1920\u0026rsquo;s: oppressive and outdated. And I\u0026rsquo;d hope that the children educated in those schools of the future grow up to be kinder, freer, and more open people than we are today.\n"

                "body": "Or: how to finish your thesis.\nI recently learned that my thesis, as written, does not have enough supporting evidence - something I had suspected months ago but only confirmed in the last week. Fixing this means I need to perform a somewhat time-intensive experiment, which will take months, delay my graduation by a full semester, and require me to spend over a thousand dollars on tuition for the privelege of further bolstering my university\u0026rsquo;s publication record. I\u0026rsquo;m writing this essay because I\u0026rsquo;ve found that I am unexpectedly delighted with this outcome.\nAs an undergraduate engineering student, the quality of my work didn\u0026rsquo;t matter. People were mostly concerned with their grades, and grades were usually determined by very legible metrics. If the code passes these test cases, you get this score; if your robot completes this benchmark, it will receive this many points. Almost all of these metrics were purely objective and known ahead of time. There are advantages to this system: it holds everyone to the same standard, and you generally know what your grade will be ahead of time, so you can allocate time efficiently. It also makes administering large classes easy with a small staff, because grading can often be significantly automated. However, the fact that a piece of code works and runs in a certain amount of time does not automatically make that code good.\nAs a researcher (which is how I have spent the majority of my professional life), the quality of my work mattered very little most of the time. Research code generally isn\u0026rsquo;t written for the long-term. The point of research code is to produce tables and figures for a paper or maybe a demo. Sometimes you\u0026rsquo;re making something that needs to be a little more consistent, but this is less common. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong: the actual products you make in the research process need to be high-quality, it\u0026rsquo;s just that the actual products are usually papers or presentations, not technical work. I would guess that well under 10% of my research time was spent on work that needed to be high-quality.\nIt is deeply disheartening for me to have my work accepted and rubber-stamped when I know that it\u0026rsquo;s actually not very good. When you try your best and fail, it can be discouraging, but it also motivates you to improve. When you phone it in and succeed, with no indication that anyone would expect you to be capable of more than this, or try harder than this, everything you do starts to feel pointless.\nBut on my thesis, someone cares whether the work is good or bad, for some opaque definition of \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;bad\u0026rdquo; that depends, at least in part, on the fact that I individually could do better. And I\u0026rsquo;ve found that, somewhat unexpectedly, I care too. Yes, my degree is ultimately just a piece of paper I\u0026rsquo;m hoping will give me an edge in beauracracies that can\u0026rsquo;t find better ways to assess competence, but I now realize that\u0026rsquo;s not all there is to it.\nI used to think that the best way to deal with mind-numbing beauracracy is to minimize contact - and I do still think that\u0026rsquo;s sometimes true. Sometimes it\u0026rsquo;s better to lie, or do the absolute minimum to check a box, or break the rules. But cynicism should also be balanced by clear, affirmative intentions. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to point out when things are impractical, imperfect, or just plain bad ideas. I\u0026rsquo;ve done it before, and I\u0026rsquo;ll do it again; it\u0026rsquo;s a useful skill that can save you a lot of time and pain. But people also need things to believe in and orient themselves towards; for me, the quality of the things I make is one of those ideals. My thesis will be done in a couple of months, and it will be a work that I can be proud of.\nn.b.: there are obvious consequences of this way of thinking for how schools, and particularly higher education, should be run. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably have a post on this later, as it\u0026rsquo;s a complicated subject and rationalist bloggers are supposed to have strong opinions about it.\n"

I\u0026rsquo;d heard about this previously but hadn\u0026rsquo;t looked into it yet, and the tl;dr for this post is that I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s particularly well-supported by the evidence unless you\u0026rsquo;re pregnant or a very young child (\u0026lt;3 years old). I do want to give a shoutout to Elicit for building a very cool product that lets me quickly browse through literature for fields I don\u0026rsquo;t understand well. It\u0026rsquo;s not a mature tool, but I think it\u0026rsquo;ll be incredible in a couple of years.\nThere seems to be a fair bit of evidence suggesting that choline supplementation is helpful for young children. This was observed in rats at least as early as 1988. A 2021 meta-analysis suggests possible mechanisms for this.\nIn humans, a 2015 meta-analysis finds small to no effects of choline supplementation on a variety of health and performance factors. They find that it might improve cognition, but point out that high-quality interventional studies aren\u0026rsquo;t available. One RCT was published earlier the same year, showing that choline supplementation seemed to improve cognition in people who performed poorly on a test and worsen cognition in people who performed well. However, this RCT had a sample size of just 24 people and I suspect what they measured was regression to the mean.\nOn the other hand, choline does seem to correlate with depressive symptoms according to this meta-analysis. I\u0026rsquo;ve had issues with depression and don\u0026rsquo;t want more, so this would be enough to make me very cautious even though correlation doesn\u0026rsquo;t, as we all know, imply causation.\nThis is already sort of enough for me to not take a supplement. Evidence for benefits is sparse and the risks seem pretty significant, relatively speaking. But as a final check, I got on the Nootropics subreddit and searched for choline. And results seem\u0026hellip; pretty underwhelming. Most people say they didn\u0026rsquo;t really feel anything, a couple of people said they did a little better on some of the supplements, and a couple people said they had significant depression. A skip for me. For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, creatine seems to have much better evidence for improving cognition, and it improves physical recovery, and it has no side effects that I know of. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why choline made Aaron\u0026rsquo;s list and creatine didn\u0026rsquo;t.\n"

                "body": "How to use the internet without turning into a zombie\nWelcome to the internet! I see you\u0026rsquo;re new here; let me show you how things work around these parts. This is a pretty dangerous place - not in the exciting cyberpunk sense, it can\u0026rsquo;t kill you, but if you\u0026rsquo;re not careful it will turn you into a zombie and use you for fuel. Actually, the whole cyberpunk thing isn\u0026rsquo;t terrible as a metaphor: as on all frontiers, the internet features a few savvy people who exploit the system in ways that are increasingly illegible to the vast majority of their peers.\nThe most obvious way this happens is with companies that profit from picking low-hanging fruit (like Facebook and Uber). Then there\u0026rsquo;s the influencer/YouTuber class. I\u0026rsquo;m not really talking about either of these groups. Instead, I mean that there are some people who benefit in real life by essentially freeloading in environments where other people are monetized.\nDangers of the Internet \u0026hellip;And you will have a window in your head.\nNot even your future will be a mystery any more. Your mind will be punched in a card and shut away in a little drawer. When they want you to buy something they will call you. When they want you to die for profit they will let you know. So, friends, every day do something that won’t compute\u0026hellip; - Wendell Berry, Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front\nThe standard form for this part: \u0026ldquo;the internet gave us cool things like email, but look at how much time teenagers spend on social media!\u0026rdquo; That one study where girls on Instagram have low self esteem gets mentioned, and also maybe something about political divisiveness. These problems are real, but there\u0026rsquo;s no more alpha in talking about them. I\u0026rsquo;d suggest that the problems you ususally hear talked about are symptomatic of a greater problem: zombification.\nJames C Scott has an excellent book, which I might review at some point, called Seeing Like a State. For now I\u0026rsquo;ll point you at Venkatesh Rao\u0026rsquo;s review if you want to learn more about the book, but, to oversimplify a book about the dangers of oversimplification, Seeing Like a State is about an idea called legibility. Legibility is how easy a system is to understand from the outside. To take an example from the book: for a very long time, people in England (and throughout Europe) had no fixed last names. A man named John might be referred to as \u0026ldquo;John Cooper\u0026rdquo; (because he made barrels), \u0026ldquo;John Short\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;John Thomasson\u0026rdquo; (for obvious reasons) in different contexts. One person might have had a dozen surnames. However, this makes it very difficult for a government to take a census and figure out who they can tax or draft in a particular town. So the government tried to assign everyone fixed last names and take a census using those. Unsurprisingly, this was not popular, and census-takers were often stoned or run out of town.\nThis general form appears frequently in Seeing Like a State: a large organization (usually a state) finds that it needs to interact with a messy, organic reality, so it invents a legible abstraction to interact with instead. But the abstraction becomes reality: people still have last names like Cooper from when their ancestors\u0026rsquo; names were frozen centuries ago. The naming example seems like a relatively harmless case to me, but this reification can have huge consequences, for better or for worse.\nI mentioned zombification earlier. The zombie, obviously, is a metaphor for someone who has lost their individuality and become an avatar for consumerism or something. But another way to look at it is that a zombie is someone who has become perfectly legible. What a zombie wants, who they talk to, what they do and see and feel - these things can all be perfectly understood from the outside. And for internet zombies, they are all perfectly understood by the internet, because they are manufactured by the internet. Not all zombies are the same, you get to choose what kind of zombie you become. You can be a redpill zombie, a pro wrestling zombie, a fashion zombie, the choices seem endless. But they\u0026rsquo;re not, of course; I would think there are only a few hundred types.\nA number of years ago, I was talking with an acquaintance who was surprised by the precautions I take to stay private online. I asked her if she noticed that things she looked at on social media, searched for, or emailed about tended to show up in ads. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it creepy how they\u0026rsquo;re stalking you, I asked? No, she said, she liked the convenience of getting ads that were relevant to what she wanted.\nThe most powerful entities on the internet have a vested interest in making you as legible as possible; they want you to be a type. The echo chambers everyone worries about drive engagement, but they also drive homogeneity not just of opinion but of identity, and it\u0026rsquo;s easier to write ads for a homogenous audience. Zombification, becoming a type (or collection of types) instead of a person, is the first significant danger of the internet.\nThe second danger is torpor. Even if you remain an individual on the internet, it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to disengage from the world because the internet is more compelling. I think of this as a raising of the activation energy you need to do something in real life. There\u0026rsquo;s an ideal level of activation energy, I think: some people already have lots of energy or very low activation energy and tend to overcommit themselves to low value-add stuff because they don\u0026rsquo;t explore enough alternatives. Other people, like me, tend to spend a lot of time thinking and reading and learning new things on the internet without getting a lot of benefit out of that because they never end up putting it into practice. If you\u0026rsquo;re the second type, you should probably bias against doing too much in-your-head type stuff, probably even to the point of being bored. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just an argument against spending a lot of time on the internet, but also against reading, TV, podcasts, etc.\nWhy Internet Then The thing about the internet is that it\u0026rsquo;s basically a lottery: there are high potential rewards and a low chance of winning them. A lot of people know this, but think winning means becoming a tech founder or influencer. In fact, the most common way to win is by learning something really, really useful. For example, I learned how to code online by taking free classes, and it completely changed the path of my life. A friend of mine learned about modern dhamma online (by which I mean stuff like Mark Lippman\u0026rsquo;s meditation book or MCTB) and ended up getting heavily involved in the community, meditates daily, and has experienced some of the jhanas. People learn technical skills and discover ways to improve their mental, physical, and spiritual health online.\nOnce you figure out the risks and rewards, the rest is just math - you should spend time online if it has greater positive expected value than other ways of spending your time. I think it does. The mean probability of finding something really useful (and I think that most of the value does come from the rare, life-changingly useful stuff) on a given day is probably somewhere around 1 in 1000, so you would expect to find gold once every couple of years, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for it every day. There are also lots of kind-of-useful things you find much more often (like a good recipe or something), but that\u0026rsquo;s less valuable.\nWhat Do: General I\u0026rsquo;d expect the 1/1000 number I gave above to vary by as much as an order of magnitude depending on the person and how they use the internet. In other words, some people might spend a decade on the internet and find nothing life-changingly useful, and other people seem to find really excellent stuff every few months. I think strategy accounts for a lot of this, so it\u0026rsquo;s worth finding one that works well. I\u0026rsquo;m into a lot of rationalist-adjacent stuff, so I\u0026rsquo;d probably suggest Astral Codex Ten and TPOT (stands for This Part Of Twitter and doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have a website, but @visakanv is well-connected to TPOT people and you can also look at who I\u0026rsquo;m following) as good starting points for finding high-value stuff. If you want to learn engineering stuff, Steve Brunton is a treasure.\nWhat you want to avoid - or at least limit - is pure entertainment. Right now, the most popular YouTube channels by view count are all pure entertainment: WWE, a bunch of unboxing channels for kids, and a couple of music artists (if you limit yourself to US channels, that is; there are a bunch of very popular Indian channels too). I have a few friends who might object to the idea that listening to Taylor Swift is unlikely to be life-changing, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to stick by it - and she\u0026rsquo;s probably the most helpful in the top 50. When you do engage with pure entertainment, I think consciously developing good taste is helpful too. Sometimes you want to completely turn off your brain and see something totally mindless, but other times you can compromise between entertaining yourself and extracting value by finding entertaining content that\u0026rsquo;s genuinely useful, like a really excellent movie (if you want a recommendation, I think you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with a Studio Ghibli movie).\nWhat Do: Specific A lot of websites stay up by advertising to you. Some of them, like DuckDuckGo, are doing this in relatively responsible ways in order to provide you with an otherwise free service. Most of them want to extract all possible value from you regardless of the consequences. The items in this section are a starter guide from protecting yourself from the second type. I\u0026rsquo;d expect that most people know about most of the things on this list - but in the spirit of one-in-a-thousand chances:\nStart caring about privacy. The better the Evil Forces on the internet know you, the better they can steer you into zombie attractor basins. A lot of the following stuff is just recommendations on how to do this. Get an ad blocker (uBlock origin is good for Chrome and Firefox) Use Invidious (in-browser) and NewPipe (mobile app) instead of YouTube. Neither one tracks you, and NewPipe even lets you subscribe to channels and remembers where you left off in videos by keeping that data stored locally on your phone, where it can\u0026rsquo;t be used to track you. Don\u0026rsquo;t browse the web logged into Facebook, Google, etc. If this is too inconvenient for you, one thing you can do is have a clean browser/dirty browser. So maybe you\u0026rsquo;re logged into Facebook, Google, and Amazon on Chrome, but you use Firefox for everything else (and set cookies to regularly clear on Firefox). I also don\u0026rsquo;t search for products on Amazon while I\u0026rsquo;m logged into my account - I figure out what I want first in a private session, then copy the link (without the tracking junk) into a window where I\u0026rsquo;m logged in. Try to minimize privacy invasions on your phone. Disable advertising ID. If you can, avoid having invasive apps like Facebook or anything they own (WhatsApp, Instagram, FB Messenger) or TikTok. You probably get the general idea here - treat all companies whose business model involves monetizing you as hostile to you "

                "body": "Thoughts on The Direct Path, by Greg Goode\nThe Direct Path: A User Guide is a book on a spiritual tradition of the same name (without the user guide bit). It\u0026rsquo;s strongly influenced by Advaita Vedanta (part of Hinduism), but is largely Buddhist-compatible too. I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading and practicing from this book for several months, and I\u0026rsquo;ve collected some thoughts below. The book takes the form of a series of experiments through which the reader, as they follow along, is led to perceive the nondual nature of reality. Goode argues (for most of the book) that awareness is the ultimate nature of reality.\nRealism On its own, this would not be a very spicy take. The spice comes from the fact that Goode argues this view over what he calls Representative Realism (RR). RR is the model of experience we all know: objects, which exist in the world independently of being observed, interact with sensory organs in our bodies according to the laws of physics, which produces sensation. Sensations are then interpreted by the mind to produce mental objects such as perceptions. According to The Direct Path, the important claims of RR are:\nThe external object causes the mental object The mental object represents and resembles the external object. The Direct Path argues that RR is never confirmed by direct experience and that there is only awareness, and this is where I bounced off of it a little. Technically, both of these statements are true. As anyone who has encountered solipsism can confirm, we never directly experience anything like an \u0026ldquo;external object,\u0026rdquo; which is already enough to prevent us from confirming these claims. It\u0026rsquo;s similarly obvious that there is only awareness (we\u0026rsquo;ll get back to awareness). But solipsism is boring, and The Direct Path isn\u0026rsquo;t solipsism. The book spends some time making solipsistic-sounding claims, and I think this part of the book makes it worse.\nFor instance, Goode has a section devoted to explaining why, if everything is pure awareness, our senses seem to correlate (for instance, I can see that something is round, then feel it and confirm that it\u0026rsquo;s round). Goode essentially argues that this is pure correlation: we learn correspondences between kinds of awareness, but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow us to establish that there\u0026rsquo;s actually a \u0026ldquo;real object\u0026rdquo; producing the correlation.\nThis sounds a lot like soplisism! In all probability, the reason our senses correlate is that our sense data really is generated by and is in some way representative of physical objects. It would be very, very strange if the physical world didn\u0026rsquo;t exist, and spending time on the fact that we can\u0026rsquo;t ever prove this can sound like freshman philosophy navel-gazing. That said, I\u0026rsquo;d like to steelman Goode (or at least provide my understanding).\nRR is, as Goode notes, not a theory we can prove. It is a post hoc explanation for phenomenological experience - we notice that visual patterns of a particular sort seem to correlate with a particular tactile quality, and we explain this by generating a concept (ex: \u0026ldquo;roundness\u0026rdquo;) to which we asribe both visual and tactile qualities. If you\u0026rsquo;re technically inclined, you can think of this as a sort of dimensionality reduction, where sensory experience is projected into a conceptual latent space. As far as explanations go, RR seems like a pretty good one! The tricky thing about it is that it sort of claims to be outside itself. RR has a little black box for \u0026ldquo;the brain interpreting your experiences,\u0026rdquo; and the real stuff is happening outside that black box. But actually, RR itself is entirely within that exact black box - it is, as I said, an explanation for experience, a conceptual overlay. In a way, RR is the opposite of true: the only real stuff that you know is happening is the experience happening in the black box, while you imagine that this is experience is generated by inaccessible Platonic objects of some sort.\nRR is useful, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to realize (as distinct from understanding) that it\u0026rsquo;s just a conceptual overlay, because it can lead you to make a number of cognitive errors that result in greater suffering. So, I think a great starting point for The Direct Path is something like: acknowledging that RR is an excellent model of experience that produces extremely consistent results and allows us to do very impressive things, let\u0026rsquo;s set it aside and investigate the phenomenology it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to explain. For the purposes of this book, we aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in whether RR is true, we\u0026rsquo;re interested in coming as close as possible to directly investigating our own experience.\nExample An example of an early experiment in the book: you close your eyes, ring a bell, and pay close attention to the experience of hearing the bell (ignoring all other sensations). Then you walk through questions like:\nDo you experience a separate or independent perceiver? One of the most common assumptions regarding perception is that there is an independent perceiver who is on the ultimate receiving end of incoming sense data\u0026hellip; But going by the sounds themselves and not by thought, inference or imagination, do you actually experience a separate hearer or perceiver? What would the hearer sound like? Do you experience a bell to be independent of sound? We usually think that the object (i.e., the bell) is a truly existing object which causes the impressions we have of it. This is the object that we think exists outside the “veil of perception.” Let’s see if this idea is verified in direct experience. Don’t go by what you think must be true in order to explain perception. Instead, go by your direct experience. You do seem to experience the bell-sound. But do you also experience a bell making the sound? In other words, do you experience a bell in addition to the sound? If you do experience a bell making the sound, this would help verify the notion that the bell exists objectively. You would be directly experiencing an independent bell. You would be experiencing a bell existing outside your experience. But do you? Going by hearing alone, is there anything directly experienced about the bell other than a bell-sound? Do you experience a sound to be independent of hearing? We may think that not only the bell, but the sounds themselves are objective. This is because we think the objective bell is causing sounds to exist, which we then pick up and which become sensory information. We often think that the sounds are actually present, waiting for us to come along and hear them. But let’s look into it more closely: Do you experience a sound waiting to be heard, a sound outside the scope of your hearing? In other words, do you directly experience a sound already present which you then proceed to hear? Yet another way of looking at this question would be: Do you experience an unheard sound? Also check: do you experience the sound as separate from you? Do you experience it to be at any distance from you? Do you experience hearing to be independent of awareness? We often think of hearing and seeing as actual objectively existing faculties or abilities. We consider them to be pre-existent tools that awareness makes use of. It seems that we can use these tools to pick up information about the “outside world.” Let’s look into that. Do you experience hearing itself as something existing outside of witnessing awareness? Do you experience hearing being already present in a pre-existent way, waiting to be taken up by awareness and used? Do you hear hearing? Now think about the other senses for a moment. Do you see hearing? Do you taste or smell hearing? Witnessing awareness – Try to scan your direct experience: Do you directly experience a moment when awareness is absent? Whether there are bell-sounds or not, do you experience a moment in which awareness is not there? Awareness OK, so if \u0026ldquo;awareness\u0026rdquo; is being used in a specific, nonstandard way, what is it? It\u0026rsquo;s hard to define anything that\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be the ultimate nature of reality in words, because reality pre-exists concepts (in that all concepts are objects that arise within reality). What awareness explicitly isn\u0026rsquo;t, for the purpose of this book, is a process that happens in your brain. Goode claims that the \u0026ldquo;awareness\u0026rdquo; that happens in your brain is equivalent to sentience or a waking state (which at least partially checks out - I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how you would verify that a sleeping being was aware or sentient without waking it up), but notes that \u0026ldquo;the very removal of the speaker\u0026rsquo;s brain requires witnessing awareness to \u0026rsquo;take note\u0026rsquo; of it as an event\u0026hellip; we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that witnessing awareness, which is not personal, depends on the speaker\u0026rsquo;s brain.\u0026rdquo;\nThis last quote is another thing I bounced off of, and I eventually decided to pretty much ignore it. I\u0026rsquo;m fine with constructing awareness as something impersonal, but if we say that awareness needs to \u0026rsquo;take note\u0026rsquo; of something in order for that thing to happen, awareness itself has to be conscious/aware. This is another sort of strange example of the book, which really does seem to mostly be about phenomenological experience, taking an abrupt left turn into cosmology - though it is consistent with what I understand of Hindu cosmology, so maybe this is less jarring for you if you\u0026rsquo;re coming at this from that background. Much more simple, I think, would be: remember that we are investigating our phenomenology. Do you experience awareness as something that happens in your brain? When you are aware of something, do you also have the experience of having a brain that generates that awareness? Probably not; I don\u0026rsquo;t know what a direct experience of having a brain would even be like. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the purpose of the original quote was, but I think an investigation along these lines would accomplish it equally well without implying that things literally cannot happen unless an impersonal force \u0026rsquo;takes note\u0026rsquo; of them.\nSo anyway, awareness is that which contains and transcends your definition of awareness. Is this a useful definition? In some ways, yes! One of the big obstacles to spiritual progress, especially in the Western Buddhist engineer population, is transforming nonconceptual states/phrases into mental constructs and then interacting with them like any other mental construct without noticing or getting distance from the substitution. Appropriately negating the most common associations with whatever language you\u0026rsquo;re forced to use can help people not lose time this way.\nI want to talk more about awareness without defining it, so let me start over. In our investigation of our direct experience, we find that we are not our bodies. We also find that we are not our thoughts, or the voices in our head, or our \u0026ldquo;experience of being a consciousness.\u0026rdquo; We are, instead, that to which everything appears. But even this is an illusion - when we try to confirm this separation between subject and object (\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; observe \u0026ldquo;other things\u0026rdquo;) via direct experience, we find that this separation is itself a conceptual overlay. In our direct experience, there is only one thing, within which experiences simply arise, and we call this one thing \u0026ldquo;awareness\u0026rdquo; (later, awareness and experience are also dissolved, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think the book\u0026rsquo;s treatment of this is either skillful or important, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to ignore it).\nAs a Practice The point of The Direct Path isn\u0026rsquo;t to tell you about advaita philosophy, it\u0026rsquo;s to produce a direct experience of emptiness (meaning that there\u0026rsquo;s significant alpha in the book even after reading this review). I think this is incredibly valuable, but only within the context of a larger spiritual practice. This book does a very good job of producing the kind of experiences it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to produce, but in my experience too much concentrated emptiness practice makes it much more likely to have dark night-type experiences. Even if you avoid this issue, there are also potential problems with spiritual bypassing.\nThe danger of spiritual bypassing here is that as you become better at not identifying with whatever thoughts/emotions arise, you start to use this as a defense mechanism to avoid dealing with those constructs. As an example: like many people, I have a part that is absolutely terrified of rejection. When I experience something as rejection or a threat of rejection, this part produces extremely uncomfortable emotions/sensations. If I wanted to, I could dissociate from this part and alleviate my discomfort by observing that the fear I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing isn\u0026rsquo;t actually mine, that it is simply another arising in awareness, that I have the option to not experience it as aversive, etc. But always taking this option is a mistake, because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t address the underlying dynamic that produces the suffering. The fear might present more subtly later and cause me to make bad decisions without knowing why, or present so strongly that I can\u0026rsquo;t dissociate from it. I can handle this more skillfully by engaging with the part and figuring out how to help it suffer less, such that I become more aligned and kinder while resolving the harmful pattern.\nFrom a computer science standpoint, this might be seen as the relative advantages of breadth-first and depth-first searches. A depth-first search progresses as far as it can down a single path (in this case, The Direct Path), then tries the next path, and so on, while a breadth-first search looks a short ways down all available paths, then looks a little further, and so on. Developing a good feel for what path to take next and how far to push is an important meta-level spiritual skill. The Direct Path never claims to be a complete spirituality in itself, but I wanted to point out that I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend it as a sole practice.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s completely valid, in fact, to ask why you would want to do nondual practice at all. Nondual practice often results in the loss of certain abilities you usually don\u0026rsquo;t have to think about, like depth perception and being able to identify where a sound is coming from when you hear it. This is, on one level, very cool, but it also seems pretty annoying and potentially unsafe once it becomes your default (imagine driving without depth perception). If you\u0026rsquo;re going to spend hundreds of hours working to lose patterns that are usually helpful, you should expect to get serious returns on your investment.\nWith enough practice, those returns should take the form of liberation. The idea (from a Buddhist perspective) is that once you\u0026rsquo;ve done enough nondual practice, you stop identifying with the random thoughts, emotions, and mental states you go through every day. This is different from dissociating from them! If your default is that these things are just arisings and not really yours, a lot of potentially problematic patterns can be interrupted all at once. This suggests that occasionally dissociating probably isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing, inasmuch as it\u0026rsquo;s good practice for not-associating - you just need to balance nondual practice against working with the content itself. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot to say about this, but I\u0026rsquo;ll restrain myself and instead point out that most people who get far enough into nondual practice that they start having weird sensory effects generally don\u0026rsquo;t complain that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it (dark night is another story, though the general consensus seems to be that it can be avoided if you go slowly and carefully and have a good teacher).\nConclusion The Direct Path is a strange book. Overall, it\u0026rsquo;s been helpful to me and I\u0026rsquo;d recommend it to analytical-minded people who want to supplement an existing spiritual practice, but it seems to weirdly shoot itself in the foot in ways that would be particularly annoying to exactly those people. It makes weird cosmological claims and sometimes uses fuzzy reasoning in places where it could have just left out that paragraph without really losing anything. I\u0026rsquo;m left with the feeling that I\u0026rsquo;ve forced my own interpretation onto it and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit. But I ask myself: do I ever directly experience an intention from the author that contradicts my beliefs about the text? No? Well, then.\n"

                "body": "Selflessness and collectivism are not prerequisites for being a good person\nIndividualism I define individualism and collectivism as follows: individualists believe that you should do what is right and good for yourself, and collectivists believe you should do what is right and good for society/your in-group. I claim that you should be an individualist if and because it\u0026rsquo;s easier for you to be one, which I think should be the case for most people. I\u0026rsquo;ll address the exceptions first in hopes of demonstrating the rule.\nIn a few cases (pretty rare in the US), someone will grow up in a small, tight-knit community with the right cultural context that their identity is that they are a member of the community. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine this was the case in some (but not all) tribal cultures, but probably also happens occasionally for small towns and/or religious groups (I\u0026rsquo;m told this is common for Mennonites, for example). If this is you, embracing individualism will probably lead to worse short-term outcomes for you and maybe worse long-term outcomes too, because on top of having to rewrite your identity from scratch, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to learn the practical and social skills everyone else uses to exist in the world. Luckily, I suspect no Mennonites read my blog.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t grown up such that being a member of a specific community is your identity, odds are that you basically conceive of yourself as an individual - and once you understand this, it\u0026rsquo;s an extremely hard thing to forget, which is why this blog is a memetic hazard to Mennonites. If, as an individual, you believe that you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be doing what\u0026rsquo;s right and good for society, you need some way to make yourself do what you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be doing even when it doesn\u0026rsquo;t align with your interests. The psychological and social technologies for this usually target your fear of rejection (\u0026ldquo;if I don\u0026rsquo;t do thing, I\u0026rsquo;ll be a bad role (and people will like me less)\u0026rdquo;). This presents an obvious problem, which is that being a collectivist who thinks of themselves as an individual is only semi-stable: if your mental health improves to the point that you stop being sufficiently afraid of rejection, there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough external force keeping you in your role. You can keep playing it if you want to, but now you\u0026rsquo;re just doing what you think is right and good for yourself.\nAnd this is where individualism comes in. Individualism - or, more specifically, what I\u0026rsquo;ll call \u0026ldquo;skillful individualism\u0026rdquo; - is far more stable than collectivism, in that the only direction in which it\u0026rsquo;s unstable is the direction of transformative practice aimed at dissolving the individual. Skillful individualism is, for a vast majority of people, the final stage of a developmental progression I just made up:\nStage 1: egocenticity. Here you\u0026rsquo;re developmentally a child. The idea of needs or agendas more important than your own hasn\u0026rsquo;t sunk in for you yet, even if you understand it theoretically. Stage 2: (pseudo-)collectivism. You\u0026rsquo;ve understood the idea of a need more legitimate than your own, and you try to integrate yourself into some collective to serve your higher purpose. But if you understand yourself to be an individual, you probably have difficulty unlearning this - you are a pseudo-collectivist in that you can\u0026rsquo;t fully de-individuate and become an avatar of your cause/community. Stage 3: skillful individualism. You operate in groups because you like to, but are comfortable as an individual and no longer try to destroy your individual identity. You interact with needs and agendas beyond your own pragmatically: you try to advance causes you support while recognizing that you have a number of priorities to balance. Stage 4: lived nondual realization. You have had nondual realization and are able to live your life without relying on conceptualizing yourself as an individual. For the purposes of this post, I\u0026rsquo;m going to ignore stage 4 for now. The other stages might remind you of Kegan\u0026rsquo;s stages 1-4, which I discuss in my post on arrested development. From this perspective, \u0026ldquo;individualism\u0026rdquo; is at least a subset of \u0026ldquo;being able to reason about relationships\u0026rdquo; (Kegan stage 4). This might actually be a useful way to think about skillful individualism: it involves moving your relationships with others from a set of constraints (\u0026ldquo;I have to act within the bounds of these relationship templates\u0026rdquo;) to your metaphorical objective function (obviously, real life isn\u0026rsquo;t an optimization problem, so don\u0026rsquo;t take this too literally).\nAccordingly, skillful individualists still operate in groups. In fact, most of them probably spend significant amounts of time in group settings because that\u0026rsquo;s how humans operate: we love and need each other. To the extent that they want to (perhaps because they value the group or enjoy helping others), skillful individualists will even donate their time and resources to benefit the collective. In the same way, skillful individualism doesn\u0026rsquo;t preclude moral behavior, but rather provides the opportunity to establish your own moral standards. A skillful individualist does this because he realizes that promoting a community of flourishing, happy people is in his own self-interest. Eventually, the distinction between individualism and collectivism dissolves.\nSelfishness Selfishness is, in some ways, a specific case of the individualist/collectivist dynamic. The definition of selfishness is incredibly socially contingent and I\u0026rsquo;m not satisfied with the dictionary definitions. Wikipedia says, \u0026ldquo;Selfishness is being concerned excessively or exclusively, for oneself or one\u0026rsquo;s own advantage, pleasure, or welfare, regardless of others.\u0026rdquo; The problem with this is the implicit dualism of self-advantage and the well-being of others. If a skillful individualist, out of a desire to live in a clean neighborhood, picks up some litter, are they being selfish? Probably not in the way we typically mean the word, anyway.\nIn the podcast The Art of Accomplishment, Joe Hudson defines selfishness as \u0026ldquo;anything your parents told you was selfish when they wanted to control your behavior as a kid.\u0026rdquo; I think this is fair and gets at a good point, which is that the definition of selfishness we use in real life, the voice in our head that tells us we\u0026rsquo;re being selfish and are therefore bad, is usually based on some mental model of our parents. But we have a concept of selfishness for a reason: selfishness is used to describe behavior which ignores or bypasses social conventions designed to protect resources. Not picking up your dog\u0026rsquo;s poop is selfish, because cleaning up after yourself is mostly a social convention designed to protect common space. Stealing from someone is more or less selfish depending on the specific social conventions being broken; stealing a loaf of bread to feed your family is illegal, but not terribly selfish.\nNotice the distance between how we think of selfishness and the actual point of it. Having the impulse to avoid and/or punish selfishness prevents exploitation (to some degree), but for a lot of people their parent\u0026rsquo;s voice in their head goes way beyond just stopping them from gaming the system. Ever go to a restaurant and end up with the last piece of an appetizer sitting in the middle of the table until it\u0026rsquo;s eventually cleared away because everyone was too polite to take it? That\u0026rsquo;s value literally left sitting on the table because of your parents\u0026rsquo; voices in your heads.\nYoung children are selfish in impractical and unethical ways, because they don\u0026rsquo;t know any better and lack impulse control. You can think of the idea of selfishness as being something you install in children (more or less skillfully) to get them into the habit of considering others before they act. But once you\u0026rsquo;ve established your own ethics, the part of your mind that punishes perceived defection against imagined authority figures has outlived its usefulness and can only create problems. When I say that you should be selfish, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean that you should do things you think are morally wrong, I mean you should do things that you think are morally fine but activate that voice in your head. As you learn to stop being afraid of being selfish, to stop punishing yourself, you will become freer, lighter, and less stuck in your head.\n"

                "body": "On the Christian and nondual narratives around nature\nA few weeks ago, I participated in a conversation with about 15 other people about nature and spirituality, and saw an unusual pattern that I\u0026rsquo;d previously noticed myself falling into. People would say something like: \u0026ldquo;of course, humans are animals too, so we\u0026rsquo;re part of nature,\u0026rdquo; and then within moments would be talking about how humans are destroying nature. This repeated itself several times in several different people. Does it make sense to talk about nature destroying itself, or losing its relationship to itself? I think this is an instance of two different narratives being subconsciously merged.\nThe standard (in the US) narrative of human relationship to nature seems to go something like this: long ago, humans lived in harmony with nature. However, our greed and lack of wisdom led us to exploit it. Now, we risk destroying (or at least significantly harming) nature unless that greed and foolishness can be curbed.\nWhat I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize until a couple of hours after the conversation is how remarkably Christian this first narrative is - it\u0026rsquo;s about as close as you could imagine to being a secularized version of the Garden of Eden story. As a side note, this is an example of a very entertaining dance where the political left rejects Christian aesthetics while uncritically accepting Christian ideals, while the right does the exact opposite.\nThe other narrative being combined with the Christian story is the nondual story: that nature/not nature simply isn\u0026rsquo;t a useful distinction. Humans are animals and cities are biomes. If you completely accept this second story, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to talk about things like \u0026ldquo;conservation,\u0026rdquo; it makes sense to talk about what kind of environments you want to create.\nThe nondual narrative of human relationship to nature fits well with my heuristic belief that it\u0026rsquo;s generally better to accept that you have power and try to use it judiciously rather than try to wish it away - but does that heuristic apply here? First, I think it makes sense to talk about what \u0026ldquo;using power judiciously\u0026rdquo; actually means here. Very broadly, I mean it in the sense of deliberate interventions that create the sort of environments you want to see. In cities, for example, it seems pretty clear that people almost universally prefer more plants and walkability and less noise, so using power judiciously might look like having fewer, smaller streets, with the saved space going to community gardens and mixed-use zoning. In forests, judicious use of power might look like stricter regulation outlawing tree farms, while expanding and controlling selective logging. Or something. I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert in this and you probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to my specific policy recommendations - but the idea in this example is that we recognize that logging is practically important and needs to happen to support US industry, while also making sure that it\u0026rsquo;s done in a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t replace good environments (forests) with bad ones (tree farms).\nWith that said, there are a few reasons I can think of that you\u0026rsquo;d prefer a policy of \u0026ldquo;non-interference with nature\u0026rdquo; (having first decided that some places are nature) over trying to use environmental power judiciously. First is sacredness: if unadultarated nature has some spiritual quality that\u0026rsquo;s destroyed by human interference, you obviously wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to mess with it. Next is epistemic humility: can we be sure that any changes we make to nature are actually wise? Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s politics: who gets to decide what changes are good? I think the points of sacredness and humility are actually pretty reasonable, but I\u0026rsquo;d be pretty satisfied on these fronts if we set aside relatively small amounts of land that we\u0026rsquo;ll try to conserve (basically: national parks). We might eventually determine that we know enough about promoting good environments that we no longer have to hedge against our ability to do so, but this seems like it\u0026rsquo;s a long way off to me.\nThe last point, politics, raises the valid concern that incentives may not always be aligned when deliberately modifying the environment. For instance, global warming might turn Siberia into arable farmland while destroying US agriculture, which creates an obvious conflict of interest. You can\u0026rsquo;t just make a rule like \u0026ldquo;no global changes without UN consensus\u0026rdquo; or something, because local changes might have global effects: reforesting the Sahara desert would probably affect the health of the Amazon rainforest. And as anyone who\u0026rsquo;s tracked any attempt at building infrastructure in the US knows, environmental impact assessments are the work of Moloch and to be avoided when possible, at least in their current form. But the fact that it can be hard to agree on what is good doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a good reason to do nothing, especially when we\u0026rsquo;re already making global environmental changes.\nA final point here is that the nondual narrative integrates better with the fact that even in the most strictly conserved areas, humans make deliberate interventions to manage the ecosystem. We deliberately reintroduced gray wolves to Yellowstone - a true policy of noninterference would not have permitted this. A more cleverly phrased \u0026ldquo;minimize the effects of human interference\u0026rdquo; gets you out of this, but raises the obvious question of how to quantify the effects of human interference in a single quantity that we can minimize. There are other examples, too: when Iceland wanted to restore their forests, they discovered that native tree species no longer grew well due to climate change (Iceland was deforested by Vikings about a thousand years ago). So they imported non-native trees from Alaska. This seems like a pretty clear-cut case of ecosystem engineering to me: a habitat that\u0026rsquo;s existed for a thousand years is replaced by a completely different one composed of species from the other side of the planet. But I don\u0026rsquo;t find it problematic, either - the new forests will be beautiful and diverse and help stop erosion. The nondual narrative seems to integrate this better than the Christian one.\nWhat I want to advocate in this essay is a relaxation of the boundaries we put around what we care about and how. It\u0026rsquo;s obviously important to protect the commons from overexploitation, but I think at least as much harm has been done by well-intentioned incompetence as by greed. Take a look at the mistakes being made around you and what\u0026rsquo;s being done to correct them, and figure out where you can effect the greatest marginal change. Is that by agitating against strip mining? If so, great! But there\u0026rsquo;s a decent chance it\u0026rsquo;s by agitating against noise pollution or dumb zoning laws - and that\u0026rsquo;s also great! The latter items might not seem like they\u0026rsquo;re as important, but the marginal change you can make there might be greater and more durable than what you can do in \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; environmental activism.\nAnyway, this is mostly just fun stuff to think about - at the end of the day, doing anything is probably better than doing nothing, unless the thing you\u0026rsquo;re doing is bad and harmful, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to try and help with something on the grounds that it\u0026rsquo;s not the literal most effective thing I could be doing. I\u0026rsquo;ve found thinking nondually about the environment to be useful because it lets me worry more broadly and less deeply, so I see more opportunities to do good and feel less anxiety about the future. Maybe it will work for you too!\n"

                "body": "Robert Kegan on development and Venkatesh Rao on where it stops\nA number of psychologists have advanced theories of developmental psychology. Freud\u0026rsquo;s is strange and probably wrong, but he had one. Piaget\u0026rsquo;s is fairly famous, but we\u0026rsquo;re interested in adult development here. I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a little detour to explain Kegan\u0026rsquo;s stages of development as I understand them, because the first several search results I found were really bad. In each stage, you\u0026rsquo;re capable of reasoning about some things (meaning that you have \u0026ldquo;free will\u0026rdquo; in these areas - you generally have the ability to think out problems and respond in a non-mechanical way), and you\u0026rsquo;re subject to other things (you can\u0026rsquo;t or don\u0026rsquo;t have a habit of reasoning about them). In Kegan\u0026rsquo;s theory, development is about gaining the ability to reason about more and more domains.\nStage 1. You\u0026rsquo;re a baby. I don\u0026rsquo;t really remember this one or care very much about it. You\u0026rsquo;re a baby, you do baby things. To maintain the pattern, I guess you\u0026rsquo;re subject to impulses and perceptions?\nStage 2. Subject to needs \u0026amp; desires, reasons about impulses and perceptions\nStage 3. Subject to relationships, reasons about needs and desires\nStage 4. Subject to identity and ideology, reasons about relationships\nStage 5. Subject to dialogue between ideologies/metasystematicity, reasons about identity and ideology\nYou can use surveys to figure out which stage someone is at; only like 1% of adults are at stage 5.\nAdult development makes an unexpected appearance in The Gervais Principle by Venkatesh Rao, which was supposed to be about organizational behavior. The whole book is worth reading - Rao\u0026rsquo;s cynicism is, if nothing else, extremely entertaining, and it works well to make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t romanticize the workplace. But in the middle of the book, it shifts from being about organizational dynamics and starts talking about developmental psychology. As Rao points out, he is not a psychologist and isn\u0026rsquo;t advancing a clinical theory - and I\u0026rsquo;d add that Rao is in the business of advancing deliberately contraversial ideas that are at best directionally correct. In other words, how seriously you take any of this is up to you.\nRao splits people into three categories (noting that in reality, people don\u0026rsquo;t fall into them neatly but probably have elements of all three): Clueless, Losers, and Sociopaths. These names are deliberately insulting (to get you to read more) and don\u0026rsquo;t actually describe the groups they\u0026rsquo;re attached to very well. Rao says that he uses them because his book was inspired by a comic and he likes the joke too much to give it up; I\u0026rsquo;m now using them because I can\u0026rsquo;t talk about the book otherwise.\nThe Clueless are the least developed group. They crave approval, so they\u0026rsquo;re genuinely motivated by inherently worthless awards from authority figures (eg: employee of the month, getting a sticker from the teacher). They approximately map to Kegan stages 2 and 3 depending on where they are in their development. Their reliance on legible \u0026ldquo;status red herrings\u0026rdquo; is exacerbated by the fact that they don\u0026rsquo;t reason about relationships (which would be stage 4) The Losers, according to Rao, comprise the vast majority of people, and approximately map to Kegan stages 3 and 4. All Losers want their self-image validated by others, and they form groups for the purpose of mutual appreciation. Losers deliberately create illegibility around social status within their groups so that no one\u0026rsquo;s self-image is threatened; being a good artist isn\u0026rsquo;t comparable with being a good writer. The Sociopaths are a subset of Kegan stage 5. Specifically, Sociopaths are stage 5 people who take on the role of managing other people\u0026rsquo;s realities for them. The Clueless and the Losers rely on self-deception (for Losers, it\u0026rsquo;s more like mutual deception that everyone agrees not to squint too hard at), and Sociopaths accept power from them in exchange for smoothing over irregularities in their illusions. Here\u0026rsquo;s the important thing about Rao\u0026rsquo;s theory: he thinks you get stuck in one of these categories due to your strengths. The basics of this, from the book:\nYour development is arrested by your strengths, not your weaknesses Arrested-development behavior is caused by a strength-based addiction The mediocre develop faster than either the talented or the untalented In other words, if you\u0026rsquo;re good at school and don\u0026rsquo;t have some pressure to be good at social stuff, you\u0026rsquo;ll just keep being good at school. Yes, you eventually run out of school, but it takes a long time to do that, especially if you go all the way to a PhD, and by then it\u0026rsquo;s way harder to learn Loser skills than it ever would have been in high school. It\u0026rsquo;s much easier to squint at everything until it looks vaguely schoolish - and that\u0026rsquo;s how you end up vying for employee of the month. PhDs can be Clueless.\nOn the other hand, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re not quite good enough at school to consistently use it to make yourself feel good. In fact, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re not good enough at anything to consistently win at that thing, or you\u0026rsquo;re in an environment where winning too much makes people dislike you. If you want to feel good, you\u0026rsquo;re forced to learn Loser skills.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not really sure what the typical pathway is from Kegan stage 4 to 5, but Rao\u0026rsquo;s theory suggests that it has something to do with mediocrity - maybe you find that you\u0026rsquo;re not good enough at being a Loser (you keep wanting things to be legible or discover that staying in your lane doesn\u0026rsquo;t make you feel good or something). I think this is probably wrong - most of the stage 5 people I\u0026rsquo;ve met are smart enough to do really well in school and socially skilled enough to have plenty of friends. I think the transition today has a lot to do with ambition and agency. There aren\u0026rsquo;t any systems or institutions that seem to be designed to get people to stage 5, so only the ones who keep pushing on their own make it. If we want to twist this a little so Rao is still sort of right: the sort of person who ends up at stage 5 might have been good at the object-level games of stages 3 and 4, but was bad at extracting contentment from them.\nThe useful takeaway from this part of the book is that it\u0026rsquo;s important to be a little bit suspicious of the things you\u0026rsquo;re good at. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re already at Kegan stage 5, I think this keeps going: are you using your ability to be right more often than other people to feed your ego instead of deconstructing yourself or making other spritual/emotional progress? If you\u0026rsquo;ve made some good spiritual progress, are you sure you\u0026rsquo;re not doing any spiritual bypassing (cf: Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism)? And I suspect the list goes on. You could say that all of this is still just stage 5 and you\u0026rsquo;re just getting asymptotically better at being metasystematic, that\u0026rsquo;s fine too - it\u0026rsquo;s just important to observe the difference between an asymptote and a hard stop.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m done with this essay and don\u0026rsquo;t know how to finish it, I\u0026rsquo;ll offer this sentence as an example of a hard stop.\n"

                "body": "Thoughts on desire, inspired by \u0026ldquo;Sadly, Porn\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Psychopolitics\u0026rdquo;\nI\u0026rsquo;ve done some reading recently that falls under the general theme of desire, so I wanted to collect my thoughts in one place. I\u0026rsquo;ve separated this essay into my readings of two books, Sadly, Porn and Psychopolitics, and added a conclusion. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think I\u0026rsquo;ve fully understood either book, I haven\u0026rsquo;t finished either book, and I\u0026rsquo;ve ignored a lot of stuff that wasn\u0026rsquo;t relevant to the theme of desire, so I\u0026rsquo;d encourage you not to think of these as book reviews as much as book-inspired digressions.\nSadly, Porn Sadly, Porn is a 1200 page book/koan. I\u0026rsquo;ve only read a few hundred pages of it, but it basically takes the form of a series of relatively short and deeply unreadable pieces of literary/artistic criticism, mostly centering around the subject of desire. The book is, conservatively, 40% footnotes - the first page ends with an 8-page footnote, and shortly later there\u0026rsquo;s a footnote getting upset with you, the reader, for wanting fewer footnotes. The book is written as a sort of polemic, but it\u0026rsquo;s a polemic against you for being awful.\nI found this review by Jim Nelson, who also hasn\u0026rsquo;t read the book, to be really helpful as I try to understand it. The author of Sadly, Porn, who goes by Edward Teach, claims that the content of our desires is irrelevant - it\u0026rsquo;s the form that\u0026rsquo;s important. He then goes on to claim that we aren\u0026rsquo;t even capable of having desires. Nelson thinks that Teach is driving at a similar underlying point as W.H. Auden, who drew a distinction between desires and wishes. Nelson offers a simplification: \u0026ldquo;A wish is the simple act of imagining oneself as a different person, or in a different situation; a desire is imagining how one might convert one’s current self into a different person or situation. A wish is wanting to be thin; a desire is vowing to join a gym and work-out every day (even if one doesn’t act on it).\u0026rdquo; For Auden, wishes are rooted in a rejection of the self, and desires are rooted in acceptance of the self.\nI think this is a very good first pass, and it approaches a few points in the book that I want to break down. First, though I don\u0026rsquo;t see Teach draw the same firm distinction that Auden did, he thinks that people fear any desire or fantasy which is geniunely theirs, because having a desire of your own means that you have some responsibility for it. This seems to be a sort of continuous generalization of Auden\u0026rsquo;s idea in that the more room your desire leaves for personal agency, the more responsible you naturally become for it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve done a little bit of elision with the word responsible, because you can be responsible to external forces or responsible to yourself - and this was intentional, because I think Teach intends both meanings at the same time. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly obvious how you could be responsible to others for your desires: if they think you want the wrong things, or if you want the right things but seem to be unable to get them, they might lose respect for you. Along similar lines, one of the ideas in Sadly, Porn is \u0026ldquo;pretending high status to oneself\u0026rdquo;: you want to believe that you have high status among your peers, but status is often illegible. This is good, because it allows you to pretend high status to yourself - the only thing that might get in the way of doing that is if you were presented with evidence of low status too often. From here we have a jump due to Goodhart: since status itself is illegible, \u0026ldquo;evidence of low status\u0026rdquo; gets unconsciously subtituted out for \u0026ldquo;evidence of appearance of low status.\u0026rdquo; In other words, we can continue to pretend high status to ourselves as long as we don\u0026rsquo;t risk looking low-status to ourselves when we take what we think is an outside view.\nA good example of the desire/wish continuum and where Teach thinks we want to be on it: \u0026ldquo;you don\u0026rsquo;t want to ask out the pretty girl, you want her to trip so you\u0026rsquo;re forced to catch her.\u0026rdquo; We want things to work out such that we get what we want, without us exerting any obvious effort or incurring any risk of failure in getting there - ideally, we don\u0026rsquo;t even make any choices. In fact, Teach thinks that we prefer not to risk even having unique, specific fantasies of our own. My experience seems to confirm this: I\u0026rsquo;ve met a lot of people who are ambitious in a vague sort of way, in that they\u0026rsquo;ll gravitate towards things that are generally prestigious and even work hard to get those things (eg: promotions, leadership roles, scholarships, well-regarded universities, money), but I pretty seldom meet people who have ambition, in that there\u0026rsquo;s something specific about how they want the world to look in the future and they are working towards that goal.\nIn lieu of having desires of our own, Teach thinks we adopt the desires of others. I want the money and the hot girl, but only because other people want them too. People like to point out that attractiveness is socially contingent and usually changes to track indicators of wealth. The obvious fact that gets left out is that the mechanism for picking up your aesthetics from your peers is much simpler than learning to want rich people and then learning proxies for wealth: you just learn to want the things everyone else wants, and you minimize the risks of being responsible for wanting those things by fantasizing about getting them instead of making concrete plans.\nThe more desire you have in an area, the less comfortable you are with admitting agency in that area. Even people in positions of power usually pretend (to most of us) that they don\u0026rsquo;t have desires/ambitions within their sphere of influence; they instead have some higher calling or external rationality that compels their actions, and thus absolves them of responsibility. They can fail (spiritually or rationally) to act correctly according to their external driver, but are never responsible for what they want because they get to disavow wanting things entirely.\nPsychopolitics Where there are people looking to dump agency, there\u0026rsquo;s profit and influence to be gained by becoming someone who\u0026rsquo;s willing to accept it. On an individual level, Venkatesh Rao would call these people Sociopaths - his views dovetail so well with Teach\u0026rsquo;s that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem worth elaborating on here, but you can read The Gervais Principle or this Ribbonfarm post to get the flavor (he overloads the word to describe a specific role in interpersonal and workplace dynamics). But it\u0026rsquo;s also worth looking at how this effect is exploited systematically, and for this I want to talk about Byung-Chul Han\u0026rsquo;s Psychopolitics.\nPsychopolitics is a book on neoliberal governmentality, which is a fancy way of saying \u0026ldquo;how the state gets you to do things.\u0026rdquo; As generations of feudal lords have learned, people tend to do the bare minimum when governed at swordpoint, and sometimes they do unfortunate things like revolting and deposing you. Ideally, you would find a way to get people to want to do the things you want them to do, which makes them work harder and revolt less. Psychopolitics claims that modern neoliberal states (the state includes, but isn\u0026rsquo;t limited to, the government) accomplish this by indoctrinating people to think of themselves as projects rather than subjects - that is, people are made to believe that anything is possible for them if they work a little harder to make themselves a little better. In other words, they are seduced into thinking of themselves as capital, and working endlessly to exploit themselves such that the state never has to apply overt coersion.\nMany of the claims in Psychopolitics appear to be directly opposite Sadly, Porn (to the extent that Sadly, Porn makes consistent claims at all, that is - but I\u0026rsquo;ll proceed taking my interpretations as canon): where Teach thinks we\u0026rsquo;re too afraid to even be responsible for our desires, Han thinks we constantly exploit ourselves in service of getting what we want (or, more accurately, that we\u0026rsquo;ve been trained to approach ourselves as things to be exploited - Psychopolitics is a bit short on concrete claims and supporting evidence). If people really did view themselves as projects and constantly work to improve themselves, I\u0026rsquo;d expect to see them being generally more successful in most areas of their lives. One obvious example is obesity: addressing your obesity is a ridiculously effective health intervention, and most popular diets do actually work if followed (at least in the short-term), so you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect high rates of obesity unless people didn\u0026rsquo;t follow their diets (or if there was some external driver of obesity like environmental contaminants or widespread metabolic issues requiring specific types of intervention). But Psychopolitics doesn\u0026rsquo;t require that people are successful in their self-exploitation, only that it becomes second nature to them. In fact, psychopolitics works better when people are moderately unsuccessful at exploiting themselves, because too much success risks people becoming enlightened enough to disengage with the system.\nOne of the ideas in Psychopolitics is the \u0026ldquo;digital panopticon.\u0026rdquo; The digital panopticon builds on Bentham\u0026rsquo;s idea of the panopticon, in which prisoners who never know whether they are being observed by guards learn to police their own behavior. In the digital panopticon, we voluntarily reveal ourselves to the world (mostly via social media) and serve as guards to each other. The digital panopticon exerts an powerful levelling influence by making social status extremely legible and then gamifying it. When we always feel that we\u0026rsquo;re on display to the entire world (even if we think of that as a good thing), the idea of being responsible for our desires becomes still more threatening. Which means we become more willing to surrender agency around things we want, which means we\u0026rsquo;re less likely to get them, which means they can be dangled in front of us as carrots indefinitely.\nConclusion Sadly, Porn is about how we sabotage ourselves and others, ultimately (to my reading) out of fear of aloneness or rejection. Psychpolitics provides an interesting lens on how this effect is systematically exploited to turn people into units of production while collaborating with them to prevent any benefit of their productivity from accruing to themselves.\nThis essay has been mostly my opinions anyway, but in the spirit of taking responsibility for what I want: I think you should probably get some ambitions (if you already have some and they seem good to you, that is an excellent and unusual thing and I\u0026rsquo;m rooting for you). If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a place to start: elsewhere in the blog, I\u0026rsquo;ve endorsed working out as a self-development practice; I\u0026rsquo;ll reiterate that here. It seems like seeing the results of regular hard work over a longish period of time is really good for self-efficacy (aside from the normal health benefits), which will give you a boost towards being more ambitious.\nAnd speaking of, I think most people should probably be generally more ambitious, too. I\u0026rsquo;ve personally shied away from the idea of being ambitious in the past because ambitious people always seemed to end up doing business school or consulting or working for Facebook or something and I really didn\u0026rsquo;t want to end up there. If that resonates for you: just get better ambitions than those people, don\u0026rsquo;t use them as an excuse to do nothing. If you\u0026rsquo;re already generally ambitious, but don\u0026rsquo;t have specific ambitions (as in, you just want to be rich or something): you\u0026rsquo;re halfway there, and you can do better by thinking about what you want the world to be like and why you want that.\nIf you can find them, I think you should make friends with some friendly, ambitious nerds (friendly nerds with ambitions?) and consider helping them out if they have good ideas they want to try (cf: microsolidarity; this doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be monetary if you can\u0026rsquo;t afford that, sometimes feedback or introductions to the right people are just as good as or better than funding). Helping other people do something big means that you\u0026rsquo;ve already done part of something big, and they\u0026rsquo;ll be more likely to help you when you have an idea. And, being around ambitious people will naturally make you more ambitious.\nAfter reading part of Sadly, Porn, I\u0026rsquo;ve occasionally redirected daydreaming about outcomes to daydreaming about processes. I\u0026rsquo;ve also noticed that I\u0026rsquo;ve started biasing more towards trying things and taking risks that I might have been too scared to take before. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that relationship is causal, but it would be an interesting experiment to run!\nUnfortunately, due to the sheer amount of irrelevant material, I can\u0026rsquo;t really recommend either of these books, but they definitely changed the way I think. If you decide to read them: good luck. If you finish, write a review for the rest of us.\n"

                "body": "Filtering out indoor air pollution is the highest leverage one-time health intervention\nCredit for doing good research on air quality and blogging about it goes to Dynomight, I just want to boost their ideas. You should read the original post, but a brief summary of the problem it presents is: when you breathe in tiny particles, they make you more likely to get cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other things you don\u0026rsquo;t want. Dynomight looks at several countries, and if you\u0026rsquo;re in India or China, you really, really need to get an air filter, because ambient air pollution is the single most impactful factor they found for increasing your lifespan. But I\u0026rsquo;m in the US - am I OK? Sort of - cities in the US are less polluted than cities in India and China, but Dynomight still finds that if I\u0026rsquo;m not on drugs or drinking, air pollution is second only to high BMI as a health risk (as measured by disability-adjusted life-years per year).\nFortunately, PM2.5 sensors are pretty cheap, so I got one on Amazon and took some measurements. I initially got very bad news: the ambient indoor PM2.5 readings were on par with some of the world\u0026rsquo;s most polluted cities! Fortunately, a friend pointed out that this was probably a mistake, and I realized that I had misread the sensor\u0026rsquo;s spec. I fixed the problem and found that the indoor air quality in my apartment was pretty good! But Dynomight finds a pretty consistent linear relationship between DALY (disability-adjusted life-year) deficit and air pollution even at low levels, so I bought an air filter. As Dynomight points out, this is a ridiculously high-leverage intervention: it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much guaranteed to improve air quality, and it sure looks like that will extend your life. By how much? My apartment had a baseline level of 8 ug/m^3. Dynomight gives two useful ways to measure effect of PM2.5 exposure:\nYou lose 1 additional hour of DALY per hour exposed to PM2.5 levels of 2500 ug/m^3 You lose 1 DALY over your lifetime if your average PM2.5 exposure is 33.3 ug/m^3. Let\u0026rsquo;s say I spend around 16 hours a day in my apartment (this, sadly, is probably an underestimate). Over the course of a year, I expect to lose 16 * 365 * 8 / 2500 = 18 life-hours as a result of this exposure level. Over my lifetime, this means I can hope to lose something like a month and a half off my lifespan due to indoor air pollution, assuming I never move. Or I can buy this back for less than $100. This is why the air filter is so ridiculously worth the expense. I got the IKEA Fornuftig filter, which is extraordinarily quiet on its lowest setting and reduced the PM2.5 count to zero on my sensor. Nice!\nCooking Unfortunately, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t all I learned from my sensor. See, I thought it would be pretty slick to get it to to a live plot of the raw particle counts. So I set it running, did some work, and made dinner.\nAh, shit\nIn order, here is what happens in the graph: the relatively small bump is me as I start cooking. The huge spike comes from me opening the door to my office. Then I turned my filter all the way up and it starts to decay, but I get curious and bring the sensor into the kitchen, where the particle count achieves its maximum value. I then bring the sensor back to the office and close the door. Please note that the y-axis here is RAW COUNTS, NOT ug/m^3, so the graph isn\u0026rsquo;t as bad as it looks. The value in ug/m^3 in the kitchen was around 500 though, so still quite bad, and it took 3 hours to come down to normal. I estimate that cooking dinner cost me something like 20 life-minutes (from pollution - it would be weird, though not inaccurate, to add the time I spent cooking to this). I should note here that I was frying tofu, which produces more smoke than most cooking, but this is potentially very significant! Cooking dinner was equivalent to several days of ambient indoor air pollution. If I cooked like this every night, I would lose 5 life-days a year purely from the particulate matter.\nThis is interesting because it suggests that indoor air pollution follows a Pareto distribution - in this case, before the filter, 81% of the particles I inhaled each day came from 12.5% of the time (the three hours following whenever I start to cook). Malcom Gladwell has a good piece somewhere on Pareto problems (he calls them \u0026ldquo;long-tail problems\u0026rdquo;), where he suggests that any time you see a Pareto problem, you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, because you can basically concentrate all of your efforts in one place and get significant results for (hopefully) a fraction of what solving the entire problem would cost you. The obvious solution to generating too much PM while cooking is to cook outside as much as possible, perhaps wearing a mask when you have to stand right over the grill. Failing that, I ran a very informal experiment with my microwave fume hood (mounted right above the stovetop). Dynomight helpfully informs us that Kang et. al. tried the fume hood on its own and found an 86% reduction in peak PM2.5! I observed similar effects: when I cooked again the next night, I used the fume hood and particle count was down \u0026gt;90% (although I was cooking something different and less smoky, so there\u0026rsquo;s a confounding variable here).\nFinal thoughts\nUnless you have excellent reason to believe that your indoor air isn\u0026rsquo;t polluted, a PM2.5 sensor and air filter are ridiculously well-worth the investment. A filter is probably the most effective one-off intervention you can perform to improve your healthspan. Regardless of whether you get a filter, you can improve your health significantly by using the fume hood above your stove while cooking, if you have one. "

                "body": "Why I don\u0026rsquo;t think it makes sense to try to be authentic\nnb: This piece is almost entirely unoriginal. I wrote it because I wish I had read something like it years ago/I think the idea ought to spread more widely. It\u0026rsquo;s also going to be a little Buddhist-heavy. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided not to include any Pali/Sanskrit/Tibetan terms, because I suspect I don\u0026rsquo;t grasp the full meanings associated with any of them and don\u0026rsquo;t want to create confusion for someone who goes on to do \u0026ldquo;real Buddhism.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Buddhism, one of the key aspects of enlightenment is a quality of lightness and freedom that allows you to be deeply responsive to your context. We can gesture towards factors of responsiveness:\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t be responsive to a situation if you\u0026rsquo;ve misunderstood it. To recognize what\u0026rsquo;s actually happening around you, you first have to be present. This means you need to be present to the situation itself, as well as your feelings about it or concepts related to it. Presence is a big part of what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to cultivate in most kinds of meditation (like noting or most breath work). Once you know what is happening, you have to understand the appropriate way to relate to your environment. The ability to determine how one should adapt to a particular context is often called \u0026ldquo;skillfulness,\u0026rdquo; and it has a number of factors: you need to be aligned, open to your full range of emotional experiences, and willing to let go of your preconceptions about how you (or people in general, or any in-group) typically react to situations like this one. Good practices for this are parts work and somatic practices. Having understood the correct mode of relationship or course of action, you then need to actually make it happen. Obviously this can be hard, and can require apparently inflexible qualities like courage or discipline. I don\u0026rsquo;t know of any good classical practices for this - my guess is something like working out is probably pretty decent? Alignment is also really helpful here, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty unusual that you\u0026rsquo;ll run into a situation where you know something is appropriate but don\u0026rsquo;t want to do it if you\u0026rsquo;re well-aligned. An important tool for figuring out the best way to relate to your context is the realization of not-self. When you have realized not-self, you don\u0026rsquo;t automatically view situations from the reference point of your own ego (so an angry remark, for example, parses as a sign of someone hurting somehow instead of as a potential threat). You also don\u0026rsquo;t need to limit your potential responses to a situation by running them through a \u0026ldquo;is this something I would do\u0026rdquo; filter. So not-self helps you understand both what\u0026rsquo;s happening and how to respond.\nI bring up not-self because I want to talk about authenticity. In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve understood authenticity to mean something like \u0026ldquo;acting in a way that\u0026rsquo;s congruent with who you truly are.\u0026rdquo; I now think this is a bad thing to strive for and I hope this helps some reader to figure it out faster than I did. \u0026ldquo;Who you truly are\u0026rdquo; implies a self in all the ways that are likely to make you less responsive. If you\u0026rsquo;re being who you truly are, you misunderstand situations that activate your particular traumas, aversions, or desires. You also decide how to do things based on how your conceptualized version of yourself behaves in similarly encoded situations. This makes authenticity a tricky value to navigate.\nGenerally, I think the idea of being authentic can probably be replaced with more useful models, but if you\u0026rsquo;re attached to it, I think you can make it work if you interpret it differently than I did. I don\u0026rsquo;t see any problem, for example, with being authentic to your moral values, as long as you\u0026rsquo;re willing to hold the values themselves loosely enough that you can change them if they end up being wrong. I also think it often makes sense to be authentic to significant aspects of your emotional or phenomenological experience (with usual caveats about working within cultural and social contexts).\nThe last thing I\u0026rsquo;d add here is that I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to say that authenticity itself is bad. When I percieve someone as authentic, the signs of that \u0026ldquo;from the outside\u0026rdquo; seem to be something like honesty and congruence, which are both traits I value. The flipside of the \u0026ldquo;targeting authenticity will hurt your responsiveness\u0026rdquo; model is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to target authenticity, because autheticity is a bundle of traits that make more sense to target individually. If you spend your time trying to become more aligned and developing factors that promote honesty, my intuition is that you will naturally become more authentic (as percieved by others) without nearly as much risk of losing responsiveness.\n"

                "date" : "2022.08.10",
                "body": "Against a more-than-usually-persuasive argument for eating meat\nI was reading Erik Hoel\u0026rsquo;s substack and found an interesting argument on vegetarianism:\nImagine a dystopian future in which aliens with a taste for human flesh kidnapped a bunch of people from Earth and raised them as livestock on their alien planet. Humans on the alien planet are kept alive “free-range,” able to interact and live their life, but only for their first 20 years. Then they are harvested for food.\nIf you were an alien politician concerned about the ethical mistreatment of humans, would you advocate for (a) the continuation of the system but with better treatment for humans (quicker death, better living conditions, longer life), or (b) to stop the system entirely, although this would mean that humans would soon die out in one generation as they’d be unable to survive on the alien planet. Quick, which would you advocate: (a) or (b)?\nFor many of the animals we eat, we’d be consigning their species to oblivion if we stopped eating them\u0026hellip; My intuition is they’d probably choose to be born, and eventually eaten, rather than not be born at all.\nWhen I went to college and met for the first time a good number of vegetarians and vegans, I used to blow their minds with this argument—“Oh, so you say you love cows, but you also want to consign their species to oblivion?” Despite its overblown and somewhat jokey nature no one ever gave me a good counterargument. So I never stopped eating meat.\nI thought it would be interesting to look a little more closely at this, but I have two quick disclaimers: first, I like Erik Hoel and his substack, which probably won\u0026rsquo;t come through that well because I don\u0026rsquo;t think much of this argument. Second, though I do still eat meat on occasion, I\u0026rsquo;d say less than one of my meals in a given week has any meat, and even then it\u0026rsquo;s more like a slice of pork in a bowl of ramen than a steak. So I\u0026rsquo;d probably identify more with vegetarians than with carnivores - do with that as you will.\nBefore I actually deal with the argument here, I\u0026rsquo;d like to briefly digress and say that arguments of this type tend to annoy me, because the implicit claim is that you\u0026rsquo;re eating meat because of some clever argument, when you clearly thought it up as an ex post facto justification. When I ate meat regularly, I didn\u0026rsquo;t try to pretend it was an ethical thing to do. It was an unethical thing that I did because I wanted to do it. People are allowed to not be perfect, but justifications like this are a pet peeve of mine because they seem like such a profound misuse of intelligence. Again, this isn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be a knock on Erik Hoel, it\u0026rsquo;s just that this one particular thing he wrote doesn\u0026rsquo;t sit well with me.\nOK, I\u0026rsquo;m done ranting. When an argument is well-written and persuasive, I like to break it down into a list to deal with it:\n(Approximately) per Kant, we should behave according to principles that we would want everyone to adopt. The lives of hypothetical future livestock deserve moral consideration If people universally stopped eating meat or significantly reduced their meat consumption, livestock populations would fall, which corresponds to a destruction of hypothetical future livestock This argument already looks pretty shaky to me. Hoel\u0026rsquo;s argument boils down to \u0026ldquo;we need to buy meat to fund factories that maximize livestock production.\u0026rdquo; This means that for any amount of funding, the most ethical thing to do with it is raise the maximum breeding population you can sustain, then get them to produce as many offspring as possible, euthanizing most of the babies (except those that will form the next generation of the breeding population). Any other choice counterfactually kills animals that \u0026ldquo;would probably choose to be born.\u0026rdquo; The fact that you\u0026rsquo;re killing them anyway doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, according to Hoel - the important thing is maximizing number of births. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a good ethical system to me.\nI could also point out that if, as Hoel seems to imply, humans and livestock deserve equal moral consideration (more on this later), we have the duty to breed humans, meaning that birth control of any sort, including through abstinence, is immoral (in fact, this works even if humans deserve greater moral consideration - think of the hypothetical babies you\u0026rsquo;re killing with all the sex you\u0026rsquo;re not having). I could even combine the two arguments: imagine the utopia you could create by combining constant unprotected sex with a pre-commitment to killing most babies as soon as they\u0026rsquo;re born. Any takers?\nAnother weird aspect of Hoel\u0026rsquo;s argument is that, above a moral duty to eat meat, it implies a moral duty to donate to livestock farmers. Surely they could raise more animals in better conditions if they didn\u0026rsquo;t have to incur the overhead of killing, butchering, packing, and shipping them - and I\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the whole supply chain. This isn\u0026rsquo;t an argument that eating meat is bad any more than effective altruism is an argument that donating to museums is bad, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say that anyone who claims to be eating meat based on Hoel\u0026rsquo;s argument is, by their own claimed values, behaving very inefficiently if they don\u0026rsquo;t donate money to livestock farmers.\nHoel\u0026rsquo;s argument cleverly implies by its initial analogy that there is some level of moral equivalence between livestock and humans. This makes it a lot more convincing at a surface level, because the idea of humans going extinct is scary, so we feel less comfortable with the idea of letting cows go extinct when the two ideas are tied together. But most people would agree that humans deserve greater moral consideration than cattle - under what circumstances would you be willing to eat a person, as opposed to a steak? This opens up space to examine alternatives to large-scale livestock farming more closely.\nLivestock farming is significantly less space-efficient per calorie than farming produce, so when you think about large-scale replacement of livestock farming with produce farming, you have to consider that huge tracts of land will presumably, over a few hundred years, revert from farmland to biodiverse habitats appropriate to the relevant biome (grassland, old-growth forest, etc). Let\u0026rsquo;s say the land would eventually revert to being a forest. I\u0026rsquo;d argue that the hypothetical inhabitants of that forest deserve equal moral consideration to hypothetical future livestock. Or, to think of it another way: what if I told you that a new cow species had been discovered that was more resistant to disease and tasted better than the ones we have now? Would you have any problem phasing out the old cow species for the new one? I\u0026rsquo;m sure this has happened several times without triggering a moral crisis - but this situation is pretty much equivalent to replacement of farms with forests, except the new breed of cow is a bunch of wild animals.\nWe can also attack the Kantian aspect of Hoel\u0026rsquo;s argument: the reality is that everyone isn\u0026rsquo;t going to adopt my principles. I\u0026rsquo;d be very surprised if 20% of the US population ever becomes vegetarian on principle. As an individual person who can\u0026rsquo;t make anyone else\u0026rsquo;s choices, my options are:\nFund an institution that brutally tortures animals for years until eventually killing them Pay more money for ethically raised meat (and invest time to figure out what, if any, meat is ethically sourced) Hunt for my meat Eat other things Unlike the politician in Hoel\u0026rsquo;s hypothetical, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;destroy the livestock industry\u0026rdquo; option any more than I have a \u0026ldquo;reform the livestock industry\u0026rdquo; option. I can choose to participate in systematic torture or not. Usually I opt not to; sometimes the pork dumpings at the restaurant look too good to resist. But I don\u0026rsquo;t convince myself that I\u0026rsquo;m doing something noble by eating them.\n"

                "body": "If you saw a ghost, would you believe in it?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been asking friends (and a couple of strangers) questions about ghosts. Specifically, I had these questions:\nIf you saw a ghost, would you start believing in ghosts, or would you think you were hallucinating? Let\u0026rsquo;s say you go to a psychiatrist and they tell you that based on your experience of seeing ghosts, they think you might have condition X, which very rarely presents any danger to you or others. However, they can offer you some medication to stop you from seeing ghosts, if you want. Do you take it? Let\u0026rsquo;s assume the ghost seldom talks to you, but when it does, it tells you things that you didn\u0026rsquo;t know and that usually turn out to be true. Does that change your decision on whether to take the meds? (This one only if they thought they were hallucinating): Is there any experience you could have of the ghost, without anyone else perceiving it, that would give it the same ontological status for you as other people? Let\u0026rsquo;s assume it\u0026rsquo;s too enigmatic to participate in experiments like having a friend write down a random number and asking the ghost what they wrote. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been formally tracking results, but here are some informal observations:\nA number of people said that their first response would be to assume that someone was playing a joke on them, which hadn\u0026rsquo;t even occurred to me. After that, people overwhelmingly thought that they were hallucinating. One person gave an 80% chance that ghosts existed after seeing one; only two people believed in ghosts a priori I found out that a lot of people have associations with the word \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo; that I don\u0026rsquo;t. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t assume that a ghost was unfriendly, but virtually everyone I talked to did. A number of people also focused on the visual aspect of perceiving the ghost. A better way to communicate the question probably would have been \u0026ldquo;sensed a spirit,\u0026rdquo; but this seemed to me like it might scare people people off. But who knows - maybe people would be more willing to believe in a ghost that they could sense without seeing. People seem to have a healthy skepticism of psychiatric pharmacology. Among all the people I spoke with, none of them were willing to take the medication (the person who came closest wanted to try psychadelics and IFS therapy first). To quote someone who summed up responses here: \u0026ldquo;nahh seems sketchy.\u0026rdquo; The ghost\u0026rsquo;s predictions changed zero minds. Interestingly, this was true with regards to the medication, but also wrt the existence/nonexistence of the ghost: materialists remained solidly committed to materialism. None of the materialists I asked could be convinced that the ghost existed without experimentation of some sort. I\u0026rsquo;d also like to note that I\u0026rsquo;m an engineer, and most of my friends are also engineers. That\u0026rsquo;s a pretty big sampling bias.\nAlright, cool, so what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this? I\u0026rsquo;m interested in how (un)willing different people are to commit to their phenomenological experiences. One person I asked assigned an 80% probability to ghosts existing based on seeing one once. A number of people said they could never be convinced that ghosts exist without experimental evidence of some sort. What consequences do these views have? Are there better or worse ways to approach \u0026ldquo;magical\u0026rdquo; experiences?\nThe strategy I\u0026rsquo;m most interested in is 100% commitment to empiricism/materialism (I\u0026rsquo;ll drop the \u0026ldquo;materialism\u0026rdquo; from here for brevity and to avoid unwanted misinterpretation of materialism as consumerism). I suspect this strategy is over-represented in my sampling, but it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to me for reasons beyond its popularity. The big advantage of empiricism, particularly when you 100% commit to it, is that it\u0026rsquo;s self-consistent. The empiricist argument for rejecting an experience is something like: \u0026ldquo;I compare the probability that I\u0026rsquo;m hallucinating (base rate of hallucination given my individual priors) to some prior estimate of the probability that ghosts exist and one of them wants to talk to me. I find that the first probability is far greater than the second, and conclude that I am hallucinating.\u0026rdquo;\nEmpricism is probably the best tool out there for being right, but here\u0026rsquo;s my best shot at an argument against committing to it: sooner or later, most people have an experience that they can\u0026rsquo;t understand or reliably replicate. Some people have many. If you use empiricism to try to understand an experience like this, you will conclude that it was a hallucination, and you will need significantly more skill and subtlety to handle the experience in (what I\u0026rsquo;d consider) a healthy way.\nFor example, as an empiricist you could use a lens like IFS or Core Transformation, and interpret your experience as a hallucination created intentionally by some part of yourself that you don\u0026rsquo;t have direct access to (let\u0026rsquo;s say you accept these systems as useful metaphors, since I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen any studies confirming that they are literally true). If you take the correct approach towards your parts, you should take this hallucination seriously, and you can explore it by asking it questions, etc. Maybe you run into some issues with replicability, but we\u0026rsquo;ll ignore that. Aesthetically, though, this approach isn\u0026rsquo;t very empiricist and almost feels like a loophole to me. Every material thing you interact with is a mental formation whose internal state you can\u0026rsquo;t access - this approach lets you basically interact with hallucinations like they\u0026rsquo;re material objects without making an ontological commitment. But I think this lack of commitment is limiting. When we interact with a spirit, there is a chance of being knocked flat on our backs, of being completely destroyed, of being defeated and humbled by something older and vaster than ourselves. When I interact with a part, this possibility seems pretty remote.\nNow, there\u0026rsquo;s a very good chance this just means I\u0026rsquo;m doing IFS wrong or something - but that\u0026rsquo;s the point I\u0026rsquo;m trying to make. As an empiricist, I can put a great deal of time and effort into realizing increasingly nuanced conscious understanding of an idea, and if I\u0026rsquo;m very clever or have a good teacher I might eventually gain a level of understanding that allows me to interact with it skillfully. But by strategically relaxing my empiricism when I don\u0026rsquo;t feel that it\u0026rsquo;s useful, I have the opportunity to meet my phenomenological experience with openness and curiosity in a way that I just don\u0026rsquo;t think I could do if I was busy trying to figure out what makes it tick. Plus, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with some of the weirdness that comes with selectively invalidating my own experiences. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to selectively invalidate your experiences, you need to be really, really careful about your priors, especially the ones related to what kinds of experiences are valid. By biasing towards updating based on experience, I can afford to be wrong more, which is slack I probably need.\nIdeally, I think, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t react to seeing a ghost by questioning its material existence in the first place - at least, not while I was having the experience. Even the question of whether something exists has a distinctly empirical flavor to me. The concept of existence itself brings in a bunch of tricky assumptions, so even just asking myself whether something exists might lead to modes of thought that aren\u0026rsquo;t useful for a mystical experience.\nA blogger asked Joshu, \u0026ldquo;If you saw a ghost, would you start believing in ghosts, or would you think you were hallucinating?\u0026rdquo;\nJoshu replied, \u0026ldquo;mu!\u0026rdquo;\nAnyway, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to imply that there are right or wrong answers here. Empiricism plus skillful practice is probably at least as good as mysticism at promoting wholesome choices, and it has the benefit of being more explainable to a lot of people. I\u0026rsquo;m just saying that if you did want to fuck around and find out, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t blame you.\n"

                "body": "In which I ramble until I run facefirst into Joshu\nA few anecdotes:\nI recently saw this Twitter thread, which basically said that the standard getting-to-know-you questions (\u0026ldquo;what do you do?\u0026rdquo;) are boring and came up with some much more thoughtful alternatives (\u0026ldquo;what have you been excited about lately?\u0026rdquo;). I liked Richard\u0026rsquo;s questions way, way more than the standard ones and was pretty excited to try them out. So I looked at the replies to the tweet and\u0026hellip; commenters mostly didn\u0026rsquo;t like them. Several people said they would come up with an excuse to get out of a conversation with someone who asked them one of these questions and avoid that person for the rest of the party. Huh.\nThis one happened a couple of years ago: a friend told me a story about how she went hiking out west and left the trail to find a spot to eat lunch. After she\u0026rsquo;d hiked for a while, she ran into someone who asked her to point them back to the parking lot. This person had gone hiking with no map, no water, and, apparently, no sense of direction or of the landscape, then left the trail to explore. My friend thought this was sort of funny/charming - I thought it was stupid and irresponsible. At the time, I described this to her as a sense that the person didn\u0026rsquo;t really respect nature.\nA few weeks ago, I discovered the excellent podcast The Emerald and the host, Josh, articulated my feelings about this perfectly. To paraphrase: there\u0026rsquo;s a modern-day tendency to romanticize nature as beautiful, friendly, and spiritually restorative. But while nature can be all of those things, that\u0026rsquo;s not all it is. Go anywhere on Earth and you are food. To plants, you\u0026rsquo;re food once your body decomposes. To animals, you\u0026rsquo;re food once they\u0026rsquo;ve eaten you or eaten something that has eaten you. Josh phrased is perfectly: \u0026ldquo;the forest wants to eat you.\u0026rdquo; Obviously, that\u0026rsquo;s not all it wants, but a clear-eyed relationship with nature needs to take this into account.\nI got the following story from the ACX Reader Review of The Anti-Politics Machine:\nA number of \u0026ldquo;development professionals\u0026rdquo; working for the World Bank decided to modernize the economy of Thaba-Tseka, Lesotho. They noticed that the people of Lesotho spent a lot of time raising cattle and planting crops, but didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to get a lot of income from selling their excess cattle and crops. Aha! An opportunity to introduce efficient markets! With a little basic infrastructure and economic restructuring, the farmers of Lesotho would be on their way to profitability. Except: it turned out that most of those people weren\u0026rsquo;t farmers. They were miners, and they kept cattle as part of a complex social system where cattle was mostly non-economic, except as a form of social insurance for those too old to work in the mines. Everyone knew where the market was, how to get there, and even the going rate for cattle - they just weren\u0026rsquo;t ranchers or farmers. So \u0026ldquo;developing the cattle market\u0026rdquo; ended up being one of the many huge wastes of money this project incurred.\nThis from the Uruk series review of Seeing Like a State. Seeing Like a State is an excellent book and the review is also valuable - I\u0026rsquo;ll lossily compress them here for brevity. The book is about how large organizations (the author, James C. Scott, focuses on states) need to simplify the world by creating legible abstractions. Governments, for example, ostensibly exist to facilitate human flourishing for their subjects (or, at least, this is the jusitification that seems most right to me). But \u0026ldquo;human flourishing\u0026rdquo; is extremely difficult to define or measure even at an individual scale, much less for a city or country. So the state creates abstractions like \u0026ldquo;the economy,\u0026rdquo; which is measured by \u0026ldquo;GDP\u0026rdquo; (the ideal legible abstraction compresses its target into a single number). Something that resists being compressed into a legible abstraction becomes, in a very real way, invisible to the state.\nAn interesting instance of this is evangelical conservatives. This bloc frequently voices their frustration with a decline in \u0026ldquo;church and family values.\u0026rdquo; When they do, they are ignored by virtually everyone except for a handful of politicians they elected. Note that this is not true for, eg, teaching creationism in public school, which is a concrete policy position that the state can see. Every now and then, though, someone comes along and says \u0026ldquo;oh, I know what\u0026rsquo;s going on here! Evangelical conservatives are upset because of the decline of manufacturing jobs in the Rust Belt.\u0026rdquo; And this gets plenty of attention from the large organizations that drive political discussion in the present day, and we have lots of lively debate about globalism while the evangelical conservatives get increasingly upset because they told us what they\u0026rsquo;re mad about, they\u0026rsquo;re mad about God and Family Values, and no one is taking them seriously. If you tell me at this point that actually manufacturing jobs are the problem, you are seeing like a state. Which isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, you understand, it\u0026rsquo;s just not the only way to see.\nAnd different ways to see are what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to talk about in this essay. The common thread of these examples is that in each case, someone interacts with their idea of a thing rather than the thing itself, with serious consequences. Our ideas of a thing are usually comprised of all the ways in which that thing looks like something we have experience with - the human brain is an excellent and subtle pattern matcher. In each of the examples I gave above, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to see the assumptions you\u0026rsquo;re making while you\u0026rsquo;re making them.\nFor example, I assumed that other people have more or less the same experience of party conversations as I do, because I\u0026rsquo;m the only person whose internal experience I\u0026rsquo;ve ever observed at a party. The problem isn\u0026rsquo;t that the reality isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious; of course other people experience parties differently than I do, the problem is that it never occurred to me to verify that. Even in the Lesotho example, the reality on the ground about how the Basotho (in case you were wondering about the plural form of \u0026ldquo;people from Lesotho\u0026rdquo;) view cattle would have been very obvious to someone who spent some time talking to them; they weren\u0026rsquo;t hiding anything.\nIt might be possible, for all I know, to come up with the perfect conversation questions ahead of time. I\u0026rsquo;m sure a lot of people have tried. I\u0026rsquo;m equally sure the World Bank has added the Lesotho example to a training PowerPoint somewhere. But I think the better way to go about things is to try to understand a situation on its own terms, which requires you to deliberately undermine your ideas about how it looks or should look. You can feel into where someone wants to take a conversation, or go to Lesotho for a few weeks and talk to the people there before you start trying to \u0026ldquo;develop\u0026rdquo; them. If, as you do this, you get obsessed with tiny details, really shake up your pattern matcher by diving into the particulars of this situation that make it unlike any other situation, you might stumble across something you never even knew to look for.\nAs a post-rationalist rule of thumb, this could probably be condensed as \u0026ldquo;simple approaches rarely do well in highly situated/contingent environments.\u0026rdquo; The reasoning behind approaches like looking for little details is that they let you start figuring out the environment instead of engineering an approach so general that it works in all environments. But it\u0026rsquo;s been phrased more beautifully by Zen Buddhism, which instructs us to always be mindful that we are complete beginners in the present moment, as there has never been a moment quite like this one.\nI like the \u0026ldquo;looking for details\u0026rdquo; formulation too, though, because it\u0026rsquo;s something concrete and fun for me to do. When I go for walks, I\u0026rsquo;ll use an app on my phone to identify whatever plants catch my eye - and I\u0026rsquo;ve been rewarded with the occasional excitement of discovering shared contexts with a new friend when I recognize a recently learned species in a different place. This has also affected my relationship with \u0026ldquo;nature,\u0026rdquo; which is evolving into a number of specific relationships with individual species.\nA monk spoke to Joshu, “I have just entered the monastery: please give me some guidance.”\nJoshu asked, “Have you had breakfast yet?”\nThe monk answered, “Yes I have eaten.”\nJoshu replied, “Then go wash your bowl.”\nAnd the monk was enlightened.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to sell this as a systematic fix. \u0026ldquo;Looking for details\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily solve any problems on its own, not least because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell you what details to look for. But it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to offer it up as a useful spiritual practice/metasystematic heuristic, whatever suits you best.\n"

                "body": "A lens on telos from the angle of friendship\nI don\u0026rsquo;t spend much time thinking about the question of why are we here. This is partially because it seems sort of impossible to answer that question in a way that\u0026rsquo;s sensitive to the vast diversity of human experience. On the other hand, the nihilist response that there is no reason why we\u0026rsquo;re here feels like a cop-out; I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably wrong and definitely unhealthy. Also, I feel like I have a reasonable handle on why I\u0026rsquo;m here (or at least: on high-level guiding principles that are useful for guiding and aligning my actions), which makes the question of why everyone else is here a lot less important to me.\nBut it occurred to me that this question and another one might be useful lenses on one another. The other question is, \u0026ldquo;what is a friend?\u0026rdquo; Sociologists might answer this question by imposing a taxonomy of friendships - I see a lot of different splits suggested, but a lot of them like to distinguish between \u0026lsquo;activity friends\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;lifelong friends,\u0026rsquo; which seems fairly legitimate, though it appears to model friendship as a binary variable rather than a continuous one (how much can friendship intensity decrease after loss of a shared activity before that relationship is downgraded to the status of \u0026lsquo;activity friendship\u0026rsquo;?). It also seems to me that there\u0026rsquo;s at least a partial ordering of relationship quality that this taxonomic model suggests and then declines to analyze.\nAs someone who uncritically bought into some version of this taxonomic model and the value system that ships with it for a couple of years, I feel fairly comfortable categorizing it as a memetic hazard. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s necessarily wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s just not as nuanced or philisophically well-grounded in its usual packaging as it needs to be to make it safe.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to introduce another lens which is, in my view, safer and healthier: a friend is someone with whom you are in a partnership that brings both of you closer to the reason you\u0026rsquo;re here. This idea isn\u0026rsquo;t original to me - in fact, it dates at least back to the ancient Greeks. The Greeks were nuts about taxonomies, they never met a concept they couldn\u0026rsquo;t break into at least two categories. In his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle makes modern-day sociologists proud by giving what I might call a basis set for friendship. In his view, all friendships were based on some combination of three aspects:\nThe intrinsic goodness/quality/excellence (arete) the friends perceive in one another\nThe pleasure the friends derive from one another\nThe usefulness of the friendship to the friends\nArete is sort of important, so I\u0026rsquo;ll briefly define it: arete is usually translated as \u0026rsquo;excellence\u0026rsquo;, and refers to the effectiveness of a person or thing in fulfilling their purpose (telos). Arete implies a fulfillment of potential in service of an ultimate purpose. A person of arete is aligned towards that which is noble - morally, emotionally, and in their actions. For people, another translation might be \u0026ldquo;flourishing.\u0026rdquo;\nNow, just based on this information, Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s taxonomy is already better than just splitting friendships into categories, because he\u0026rsquo;s suggesting that all friendships contain all three of these aspects to different extents, which allows for a lot more nuance than choosing one of a preset number of boxes. But it gets better from here, because Aristotle imposes a value system just like the sociologists do - except he analyzes it transparently. In Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s view, only arete makes for durable/high-quality friendships. Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s idea of ideal friendships progresses like this:\nTwo people meet and recognize arete in one another. Being aligned towards that which is noble, they feel goodwill towards one another.\nEach person reconizes the goodwill that the other has towards them, and becomes personally invested in the arete of that person, associating it with their own arete. The friends love each other in the same way (though perhaps not to the same extent) as they love themselves.\nOK, we\u0026rsquo;ve covered arete, so it\u0026rsquo;s time to talk about anime now. I\u0026rsquo;m going to start with a disclaimer: I haven\u0026rsquo;t watched a huge amount of anime, and I know there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of variety. As I talk about anime in this essay, I\u0026rsquo;m referring to cherry-picked shows that were recommended to me by friends because those friends thought I would like them, which is a huge sampling bias.\nThat said: most action-genre anime I\u0026rsquo;ve seen has a trope where the main character makes a friend who constantly trains with them and pushes them to improve. The friends are constantly competing to \u0026ldquo;surpass\u0026rdquo; one another (it\u0026rsquo;s really interesting to me how certain words are way more common in anime than in other genres), and over the course of the show both become stronger and more moral as a result of their competition. Sometimes the entire main cast is working to keep up with each other.\nThe alignment of this relationship with the Aristotelian ideal is almost exact - the friends are completely committed to their own and one another\u0026rsquo;s arete, which they spend the show refining and clarifying. But, strangely, I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a single analogous relationship in US TV or movies - even though western intellectual tradition is ostensibly Greek in its lineage and Japanese intellectual tradition is not.\nInstead, it appears to me that the relationships in US TV are based on acceptance and osmosis. Friends accept each other, including each other\u0026rsquo;s flaws, and over some period of time they learn certain qualities from one another, usually by coincidence, which usually correspond to improvement of some sort. One example might be the shy character who is \u0026lsquo;adopted\u0026rsquo; by a more sociable friend and eventually learns the confidence to stand up for themselves. The friends accept each other exactly as they are, but end up improving anyway. My analysis of this is that it has a lot to do with West\u0026rsquo;s Disease - we want improvement to happen to us the way it happens to the characters in the movie; thus, the movie becomes a way for us to see our fantasies played out on the screen (cf: Sadly, Porn).\nAnyway, back to our original question of why we are here. If we assume that Aristotle is right and ideal friendships develop our arete (which is excellence in service of our telos), we can infer the answers that different cultures offer us from the nature of their idealized friendships. Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s answer is sort of circular: he thinks we\u0026rsquo;re here to develop and exercise our excellence - as individuals, in the many roles we play, and as humans generally. Like I said before, I don\u0026rsquo;t have strong opinions on the telos of humanity, but Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s view seems pretty well aligned with my own vague instinct. Similarly, anime frequently has a theme of applying deep perserverance to transcend limits.\nBut in popular US media, things get even more weirdly circular. The most common trajectory of even idealized friendships in US media, as far as I can tell, is one of becoming a better friend. The friends might improve in other ways, but they don\u0026rsquo;t set out to help each other in this - in fact, we often see the exact opposite, where one friend tries to help another improve and ends up learning to respect boundaries or accept his friend as he/she is. With some caveats, I don\u0026rsquo;t really care for this. Friendship for the purpose of being a better friend strikes me as form without function, barely a hair\u0026rsquo;s breadth away from the nihilist\u0026rsquo;s rejection of telos altogether.\nThe argument for this approach, I think, would be something like: \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s not good to go into relationships with an agenda, you should accept people as they are.\u0026rdquo; I agree that you should try to accept people without forcing your values onto them - but people are constantly changing. Making a friend with the intention of fixing them is unhealthy, but making a friend with the intention of growing with them isn\u0026rsquo;t just healthy, it\u0026rsquo;s the only realistic thing you can do.\nAnd: there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to be said for agendalessness, but it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be confused with purposelessness. Sometimes, imposing our own agenda or preconceptions on a situation or interaction leads us to misunderstand, or even to do harm. But releasing your agenda should be done in service of some purpose; otherwise you\u0026rsquo;re just throwing up your hands and taking the easy way out. I\u0026rsquo;d like to see more purposeful relationships in the US and in US media - friendships based not just on mutual enjoyment and entertainment, but also on mutual recognition, nourishment, clarification, and even challenge.\n"
