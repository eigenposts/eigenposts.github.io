                "body": "Lies I have found useful\nThere is only ever one thing; Buddhism is learning to fall in love with that thing. When we fall in love with the idea of a thing, we suffer as we discover that the thing does not match the idea. This is the importance of nondual realization in Buddhism. If we break our habit of conceptualizing everything we encounter, we can suffer much less because we will not expect things to be other than they are.\nThere is alignment and there is orientation; Buddhism is concerned with both. If we are not aligned, the different parts of ourselves will want to do different things. We may be very cruel, even violent, towards ourselves before we learn to align. Orientation is what we align towards - it is what we want to be and do in our lives. This encapsulates ethics, proper understanding, and wisdom.\nBuddhism is about freedom. A free person is expansive, open, playful, vulnerable. An unfree person is collapsed, constricted, and maybe habitually defensive. One of the mental habits that most greatly increases unfreeness is tanha, which is a sort of collapsing of the mind around a mental formation. Romeo Stevens claims that a Buddhist is someone who has realized firsthand that tanha causes dukkha (usually translated as \u0026ldquo;suffering\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;unsatisfactoriness\u0026rdquo;, though Stevens doesn\u0026rsquo;t like either and prefers \u0026ldquo;a difficult emptiness\u0026rdquo;).\nBuddhism is a religion. Most Buddhists don\u0026rsquo;t have a meditation practice, and even fewer seek enlightenment. In most places with a lot of Buddhists, Buddhism is part of the social structure; there are specific norms around how to behave towards monks and people on pilgrimage. In many places, Buddhist sorcerors were and probably are particularly valued because they are seen as having especially useful magic. Many Buddhists believe in afterlives not so different from Christian concepts of Heaven (the Pure Land of the Buddha) and Hell (the Hell Realms). More western-friendly interpretations of these concepts have them as modes of experience rather than afterlives, but this is not how they are understood by millions of people around the world.\nBuddhism is simply a collection of techniques. The Buddha and his contemporaries, who died before Galileo and Francis Bacon and even Aristotle were even born, had a very practical approach to the truth: what works is true. The Buddha is known to have contradicted himself when teaching different students, because different people need to hear different things to make spiritual progress.\n"

I\u0026rsquo;d heard about this previously but hadn\u0026rsquo;t looked into it yet, and the tl;dr for this post is that I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s particularly well-supported by the evidence unless you\u0026rsquo;re pregnant or a very young child (\u0026lt;3 years old). I do want to give a shoutout to Elicit for building a very cool product that lets me quickly browse through literature for fields I don\u0026rsquo;t understand well. It\u0026rsquo;s not a mature tool, but I think it\u0026rsquo;ll be incredible in a couple of years.\nThere seems to be a fair bit of evidence suggesting that choline supplementation is helpful for young children. This was observed in rats at least as early as 1988. A 2021 meta-analysis suggests possible mechanisms for this.\nIn humans, a 2015 meta-analysis finds small to no effects of choline supplementation on a variety of health and performance factors. They find that it might improve cognition, but point out that high-quality interventional studies weren\u0026rsquo;t, at the time, available. One RCT was published earlier the same year, showing that choline supplementation seemed to improve cognition in people who performed poorly on a test and worsen cognition in people who performed well. However, this RCT had a sample size of just 24 people and I suspect what they measured was regression to the mean.\nOn the other hand, choline does seem to correlate with depressive symptoms according to this meta-analysis. I\u0026rsquo;ve had issues with depression and don\u0026rsquo;t want more, so this would be enough to make me very cautious even though correlation doesn\u0026rsquo;t, as we all know, imply causation.\nThis is already sort of enough for me to not take a supplement. Evidence for benefits is sparse and the risks seem pretty significant, relatively speaking. But as a final check, I got on the Nootropics subreddit and searched for choline. And results seem\u0026hellip; pretty underwhelming. Most people say they didn\u0026rsquo;t really feel anything, a couple of people said they did a little better on some of the supplements, and a couple people said they had significant depression. A skip for me. For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, creatine seems to have much better evidence for improving cognition, and it improves physical recovery, and it has no side effects that I know of. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure why choline made Aaron\u0026rsquo;s list and creatine didn\u0026rsquo;t.\n"

                "body": "How to use the internet without turning into a zombie\nWelcome to the internet! I see you\u0026rsquo;re new here; let me show you how things work around these parts. This is a pretty dangerous place - not in the exciting cyberpunk sense, it can\u0026rsquo;t kill you, but if you\u0026rsquo;re not careful it will turn you into a zombie and use you for fuel. Actually, the whole cyberpunk thing isn\u0026rsquo;t terrible as a metaphor: as on all frontiers, the internet features a few savvy people who exploit the system in ways that are increasingly illegible to the vast majority of their peers.\nThe most obvious way this happens is with companies that profit from picking low-hanging fruit (like Facebook and Uber). Then there\u0026rsquo;s the influencer/YouTuber class. I\u0026rsquo;m not really talking about either of these groups. Instead, I mean that there are some people who benefit in real life by essentially freeloading in environments where other people are monetized.\nDangers of the Internet \u0026hellip;And you will have a window in your head.\nNot even your future will be a mystery any more. Your mind will be punched in a card and shut away in a little drawer. When they want you to buy something they will call you. When they want you to die for profit they will let you know. So, friends, every day do something that won’t compute\u0026hellip; - Wendell Berry, Manifesto: The Mad Farmer Liberation Front\nThe standard form for this part: \u0026ldquo;the internet gave us cool things like email, but look at how much time teenagers spend on social media!\u0026rdquo; That one study where girls on Instagram have low self esteem gets mentioned, and also maybe something about political divisiveness. These problems are real, but there\u0026rsquo;s no more alpha in talking about them. I\u0026rsquo;d suggest that the problems you ususally hear talked about are symptomatic of a greater problem: zombification.\nJames C Scott has an excellent book, which I might review at some point, called Seeing Like a State. For now I\u0026rsquo;ll point you at Venkatesh Rao\u0026rsquo;s review if you want to learn more about the book, but, to oversimplify a book about the dangers of oversimplification, Seeing Like a State is about an idea called legibility. Legibility is how easy a system is to understand from the outside. To take an example from the book: for a very long time, people in England (and throughout Europe) had no fixed last names. A man named John might be referred to as \u0026ldquo;John Cooper\u0026rdquo; (because he made barrels), \u0026ldquo;John Short\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;John Thomasson\u0026rdquo; (for obvious reasons) in different contexts. One person might have had a dozen surnames. However, this makes it very difficult for a government to take a census and figure out who they can tax or draft in a particular town. So the government tried to assign everyone fixed last names and take a census using those. Unsurprisingly, this was not popular, and census-takers were often stoned or run out of town.\nThis general form appears frequently in Seeing Like a State: a large organization (usually a state) finds that it needs to interact with a messy, organic reality, so it invents a legible abstraction to interact with instead. But the abstraction becomes reality: people still have last names like Cooper from when their ancestors\u0026rsquo; names were frozen centuries ago. The naming example seems like a relatively harmless case to me, but this reification can have huge consequences, for better or for worse.\nI mentioned zombification earlier. The zombie, obviously, is a metaphor for someone who has lost their individuality and become an avatar for consumerism or something. But another way to look at it is that a zombie is someone who has become perfectly legible. What a zombie wants, who they talk to, what they do and see and feel - these things can all be perfectly understood. And for internet zombies, they are all perfectly understood by the internet, because they are manufactured by the internet. Not all zombies are the same, you to choose what kind of zombie you become. You can be a redpill zombie, a pro wrestling zombie, a fashion zombie, the choices seem endless. But they\u0026rsquo;re not, of course, I would think there are only a few hundred types.\nA number of years ago, I was talking with an acquaintance who was surprised by the precautions I take to stay private online. I asked her if she noticed that things she looked at on social media, searched for, or emailed about tended to show up in ads. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it creepy how they\u0026rsquo;re stalking you, I asked? No, she said, she liked the convenience of getting ads that were relevant to what she wanted.\nThe most powerful entities on the internet have a vested interest in making you as legible as possible; they want you to be a type. The echo chambers everyone worries about drive engagement, but they also drive homogeneity not just of opinion but of identity, and it\u0026rsquo;s easier to write ads for a homogenous audience. Zombification, becoming a type (or collection of types) instead of a person, is the first significant danger of the internet.\nThe second danger is torpor. Even if you remain an individual on the internet, it\u0026rsquo;s very easy to disengage from the world because the internet is more compelling. I think of this as a raising of the activation energy you need to do something in real life. There\u0026rsquo;s an ideal level of activation energy, I think: some people already have lots of energy or very low activation energy and tend to overcommit themselves to low value-add stuff because they don\u0026rsquo;t explore enough alternatives. Other people, like me, tend to spend a lot of time thinking and reading and learning new things on the internet without getting a lot of benefit out of that because they never end up putting it into practice. If you\u0026rsquo;re the second type, you should probably bias against doing too much in-your-head type stuff, probably even to the point of being bored. This isn\u0026rsquo;t just an argument against spending a lot of time on the internet, but also against reading, TV, podcasts, etc.\nWhy Internet Then The thing about the internet is that it\u0026rsquo;s basically a lottery: there are high potential rewards and a low chance of winning them. A lot of people know this, but think winning means becoming a tech founder or influencer. In fact, the most common way to win is by learning something really, really useful. For example, I learned how to code online by taking free classes, and it completely changed the path of my life. A friend of mine learned about modern dhamma online (by which I mean stuff like Mark Lippman\u0026rsquo;s meditation book or MCTB) and ended up getting heavily involved in the community, meditates daily, and has experienced some of the jhanas. People learn technical skills and discover ways to improve their mental, physical, and spiritual health online.\nOnce you figure out the risks and rewards, the rest is just math - you should spend time online if it has greater positive expected value than other ways of spending your time. I think it does. The mean probability of finding something really useful (and I think that most of the value does come from the rare, life-changingly useful stuff) on a given day is probably somewhere around 1 in 1000, so you would expect to find gold once every couple of years, if you\u0026rsquo;re looking for it every day. There are also lots of kind-of-useful things you find much more often (like a good recipe or something), but that\u0026rsquo;s less valuable.\nWhat Do: General I\u0026rsquo;d expect the 1/1000 number I gave above to vary by as much as an order of magnitude depending on the person and how they use the internet. In other words, some people might spend a decade on the internet and find nothing life-changingly useful, and other people seem to find really excellent stuff every few months. I think strategy accounts for a lot of this, so it\u0026rsquo;s worth finding one that works well. I\u0026rsquo;m into a lot of rationalist-adjacent stuff, so I\u0026rsquo;d probably suggest Astral Codex Ten and TPOT (stands for This Part Of Twitter and doesn\u0026rsquo;t really have a website, but @visakanv is well-connected to TPOT people and you can also look at who I\u0026rsquo;m following) as good starting points for finding high-value stuff. If you want to learn engineering stuff, Steve Brunton is a treasure.\nWhat you want to avoid - or at least limit - is pure entertainment. Right now, the most popular YouTube channels by view count are all pure entertainment: WWE, a bunch of unboxing channels for kids, and a couple of music artists (if you limit yourself to US channels, that is; there are a bunch of very popular Indian channels too). I have a few friends who might object to the idea that listening to Taylor Swift is unlikely to be life-changing, but I\u0026rsquo;m going to stick by it - and she\u0026rsquo;s probably the most helpful in the top 50. When you do engage with pure entertainment, I think consciously developing good taste is helpful too. Sometimes you want to completely turn off your brain and see something totally mindless, but other times you can compromise between entertaining yourself and extracting value by finding entertaining content that\u0026rsquo;s genuinely useful, like a really excellent movie (if you want a recommendation, I think you can\u0026rsquo;t go wrong with a Studio Ghibli movie).\nWhat Do: Specific A lot of websites stay up by advertising to you. Some of them, like DuckDuckGo, are doing this in relatively responsible ways in order to provide you with an otherwise free service. Most of them want to extract all possible value from you regardless of the consequences. The items in this section are a starter guide from protecting yourself from the second type. I\u0026rsquo;d expect that most people know about most of the things on this list - but in the spirit of one-in-a-thousand chances:\nStart caring about privacy. The better the Evil Forces on the internet know you, the better they can steer you into zombie attractor basins. A lot of the following stuff is just recommendations on how to do this. Get an ad blocker (uBlock origin is good for Chrome and Firefox) Use Invidious (in-browser) and NewPipe (mobile app) instead of YouTube. Neither one tracks you, and NewPipe even lets you subscribe to channels and remembers where you left off in videos by keeping that data stored locally on your phone, where it can\u0026rsquo;t be used to track you. Don\u0026rsquo;t browse the web logged into Facebook, Google, etc. If this is too inconvenient for you, one thing you can do is have a clean browser/dirty browser. So maybe you\u0026rsquo;re logged into Facebook, Google, and Amazon on Chrome, but you use Firefox for everything else (and set cookies to regularly clear on Firefox). I also don\u0026rsquo;t search for products on Amazon while I\u0026rsquo;m logged into my account - I figure out what I want first in a private session, then copy the link (without the tracking junk) into a window where I\u0026rsquo;m logged in. Try to minimize privacy invasions on your phone. Disable advertising ID. If you can, avoid having invasive apps like Facebook or anything they own (WhatsApp, Instagram, FB Messenger) or TikTok. You probably get the general idea here - treat all companies whose business model involves monetizing you as hostile to you "

                "body": "Thoughts on The Direct Path, by Greg Goode\nThe Direct Path: A User Guide is a book on a spiritual tradition of the same name (without the user guide bit). It\u0026rsquo;s strongly influenced by Advaita Vedanta (part of Hinduism), but is largely Buddhist-compatible too. I\u0026rsquo;ve been reading and practicing from this book for several months, and I\u0026rsquo;ve collected some thoughts below. The book takes the form of a series of experiments through which the reader, as they follow along, is led to perceive the nondual nature of reality. Goode argues (for most of the book) that awareness is the ultimate nature of reality.\nRealism On its own, this would not be a very spicy take. The spice comes from the fact that Goode argues this view over what he calls Representative Realism (RR). RR is the model of experience we all know: objects, which exist in the world independently of being observed, interact with sensory organs in our bodies according to the laws of physics, which produces sensation. Sensations are then interpreted by the mind to produce mental objects such as perceptions. According to The Direct Path, the important claims of RR are:\nThe external object causes the mental object The mental object represents and resembles the external object. The Direct Path argues that RR is never confirmed by direct experience and that there is only awareness, and this is where I bounced off of it a little. Technically, both of these statements are true. As anyone who has encountered solipsism can confirm, we never directly experience anything like an \u0026ldquo;external object,\u0026rdquo; which is already enough to prevent us from confirming these claims. It\u0026rsquo;s similarly obvious that there is only awareness (we\u0026rsquo;ll get back to awareness). But solipsism is boring, and The Direct Path isn\u0026rsquo;t solipsism. The book spends some time making solipsistic-sounding claims, and I think this part of the book makes it worse.\nFor instance, Goode has a section devoted to explaining why, if everything is pure awareness, our senses seem to correlate (for instance, I can see that something is round, then feel it and confirm that it\u0026rsquo;s round). Goode essentially argues that this is pure correlation: we learn correspondences between kinds of awareness, but this doesn\u0026rsquo;t allow us to establish that there\u0026rsquo;s actually a \u0026ldquo;real object\u0026rdquo; producing the correlation.\nThis sounds a lot like soplisism! In all probability, the reason our senses correlate is that our sense data really is generated by and is in some way representative of physical objects. It would be very, very strange if the physical world didn\u0026rsquo;t exist, and spending time on the fact that we can\u0026rsquo;t ever prove this can sound like freshman philosophy navel-gazing. That said, I\u0026rsquo;d like to steelman Goode (or at least provide my understanding).\nRR is, as Goode notes, not a theory we can prove. It is a post hoc explanation for phenomenological experience - we notice that visual patterns of a particular sort seem to correlate with a particular tactile quality, and we explain this by generating a concept (ex: \u0026ldquo;roundness\u0026rdquo;) to which we asribe both visual and tactile qualities. If you\u0026rsquo;re technically inclined, you can think of this as a sort of dimensionality reduction, where sensory experience is projected into a conceptual latent space. As far as explanations go, RR seems like a pretty good one! The tricky thing about it is that it sort of claims to be outside itself. RR has a little black box for \u0026ldquo;the brain interpreting your experiences,\u0026rdquo; and the real stuff is happening outside that black box. But actually, RR itself is entirely within that exact black box - it is, as I said, an explanation for experience, a conceptual overlay. In a way, RR is the opposite of true: the only real stuff that you know is happening is the experience happening in the black box, while you imagine that this is experience is generated by inaccessible Platonic objects of some sort.\nRR is useful, but it\u0026rsquo;s important to realize (as distinct from understanding) that it\u0026rsquo;s just a conceptual overlay, because it can lead you to make a number of cognitive errors that result in greater suffering. So, I think a great starting point for The Direct Path is something like: acknowledging that RR is an excellent model of experience that produces extremely consistent results and allows us to do very impressive things, let\u0026rsquo;s set it aside and investigate the phenomenology it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to explain. For the purposes of this book, we aren\u0026rsquo;t interested in whether RR is true, we\u0026rsquo;re interested in coming as close as possible to directly investigating our own experience.\nExample An example of an early experiment in the book: you close your eyes, ring a bell, and pay close attention to the experience of hearing the bell (ignoring all other sensations). Then you walk through questions like:\nDo you experience a separate or independent perceiver? One of the most common assumptions regarding perception is that there is an independent perceiver who is on the ultimate receiving end of incoming sense data\u0026hellip; But going by the sounds themselves and not by thought, inference or imagination, do you actually experience a separate hearer or perceiver? What would the hearer sound like? Do you experience a bell to be independent of sound? We usually think that the object (i.e., the bell) is a truly existing object which causes the impressions we have of it. This is the object that we think exists outside the “veil of perception.” Let’s see if this idea is verified in direct experience. Don’t go by what you think must be true in order to explain perception. Instead, go by your direct experience. You do seem to experience the bell-sound. But do you also experience a bell making the sound? In other words, do you experience a bell in addition to the sound? If you do experience a bell making the sound, this would help verify the notion that the bell exists objectively. You would be directly experiencing an independent bell. You would be experiencing a bell existing outside your experience. But do you? Going by hearing alone, is there anything directly experienced about the bell other than a bell-sound? Do you experience a sound to be independent of hearing? We may think that not only the bell, but the sounds themselves are objective. This is because we think the objective bell is causing sounds to exist, which we then pick up and which become sensory information. We often think that the sounds are actually present, waiting for us to come along and hear them. But let’s look into it more closely: Do you experience a sound waiting to be heard, a sound outside the scope of your hearing? In other words, do you directly experience a sound already present which you then proceed to hear? Yet another way of looking at this question would be: Do you experience an unheard sound? Also check: do you experience the sound as separate from you? Do you experience it to be at any distance from you? Do you experience hearing to be independent of awareness? We often think of hearing and seeing as actual objectively existing faculties or abilities. We consider them to be pre-existent tools that awareness makes use of. It seems that we can use these tools to pick up information about the “outside world.” Let’s look into that. Do you experience hearing itself as something existing outside of witnessing awareness? Do you experience hearing being already present in a pre-existent way, waiting to be taken up by awareness and used? Do you hear hearing? Now think about the other senses for a moment. Do you see hearing? Do you taste or smell hearing? Witnessing awareness – Try to scan your direct experience: Do you directly experience a moment when awareness is absent? Whether there are bell-sounds or not, do you experience a moment in which awareness is not there? Awareness OK, so if \u0026ldquo;awareness\u0026rdquo; is being used in a specific, nonstandard way, what is it? It\u0026rsquo;s hard to define anything that\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be the ultimate nature of reality in words, because reality pre-exists concepts (in that all concepts are objects that arise within reality). What awareness explicitly isn\u0026rsquo;t, for the purpose of this book, is a process that happens in your brain. Goode claims that the \u0026ldquo;awareness\u0026rdquo; that happens in your brain is equivalent to sentience or a waking state (which at least partially checks out - I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how you would verify that a sleeping being was aware or sentient without waking it up), but notes that \u0026ldquo;the very removal of the speaker\u0026rsquo;s brain requires witnessing awareness to \u0026rsquo;take note\u0026rsquo; of it as an event\u0026hellip; we wouldn\u0026rsquo;t say that witnessing awareness, which is not personal, depends on the speaker\u0026rsquo;s brain.\u0026rdquo;\nThis last quote is another thing I bounced off of, and I eventually decided to pretty much ignore it. I\u0026rsquo;m fine with constructing awareness as something impersonal, but if we say that awareness needs to \u0026rsquo;take note\u0026rsquo; of something in order for that thing to happen, awareness itself has to be conscious/aware. This is another sort of strange example of the book, which really does seem to mostly be about phenomenological experience, taking an abrupt left turn into cosmology - though it is consistent with what I understand of Hindu cosmology, so maybe this is less jarring for you if you\u0026rsquo;re coming at this from that background. Much more simple, I think, would be: remember that we are investigating our phenomenology. Do you experience awareness as something that happens in your brain? When you are aware of something, do you also have the experience of having a brain that generates that awareness? Probably not; I don\u0026rsquo;t know what a direct experience of having a brain would even be like. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what the purpose of the original quote was, but I think an investigation along these lines would accomplish it equally well without implying that things literally cannot happen unless an impersonal force \u0026rsquo;takes note\u0026rsquo; of them.\nSo anyway, awareness is that which contains and transcends your definition of awareness. Is this a useful definition? In some ways, yes! One of the big obstacles to spiritual progress, especially in the Western Buddhist engineer population, is transforming nonconceptual states/phrases into mental constructs and then interacting with them like any other mental construct without noticing or getting distance from the substitution. Appropriately negating the most common associations with whatever language you\u0026rsquo;re forced to use can help people not lose time this way.\nI want to talk more about awareness without defining it, so let me start over. In our investigation of our direct experience, we find that we are not our bodies. We also find that we are not our thoughts, or the voices in our head, or our \u0026ldquo;experience of being a consciousness.\u0026rdquo; We are, instead, that to which everything appears. But even this is an illusion - when we try to confirm this separation between subject and object (\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; observe \u0026ldquo;other things\u0026rdquo;) via direct experience, we find that this separation is itself a conceptual overlay. In our direct experience, there is only one thing, within which experiences simply arise, and we call this one thing \u0026ldquo;awareness\u0026rdquo; (later, awareness and experience are also dissolved, but I don\u0026rsquo;t think the book\u0026rsquo;s treatment of this is either skillful or important, so I\u0026rsquo;m going to ignore it).\nAs a Practice The point of The Direct Path isn\u0026rsquo;t to tell you about advaita philosophy, it\u0026rsquo;s to produce a direct experience of emptiness (meaning that there\u0026rsquo;s significant alpha in the book even after reading this review). I think this is incredibly valuable, but only within the context of a larger spiritual practice. This book does a very good job of producing the kind of experiences it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to produce, but in my experience too much concentrated emptiness practice makes it much more likely to have dark night-type experiences. Even if you avoid this issue, there are also potential problems with spiritual bypassing.\nThe danger of spiritual bypassing here is that as you become better at not identifying with whatever thoughts/emotions arise, you start to use this as a defense mechanism to avoid dealing with those constructs. As an example: like many people, I have a part that is absolutely terrified of rejection. When I experience something as rejection or a threat of rejection, this part produces extremely uncomfortable emotions/sensations. If I wanted to, I could dissociate from this part and alleviate my discomfort by observing that the fear I\u0026rsquo;m experiencing isn\u0026rsquo;t actually mine, that it is simply another arising in awareness, that I have the option to not experience it as aversive, etc. But always taking this option is a mistake, because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t address the underlying dynamic that produces the suffering. The fear might present more subtly later and cause me to make bad decisions without knowing why, or present so strongly that I can\u0026rsquo;t dissociate from it. I can handle this more skillfully by engaging with the part and figuring out how to help it suffer less, such that I become more aligned and kinder while resolving the harmful pattern.\nFrom a computer science standpoint, this might be seen as the relative advantages of breadth-first and depth-first searches. A depth-first search progresses as far as it can down a single path (in this case, The Direct Path), then tries the next path, and so on, while a breadth-first search looks a short ways down all available paths, then looks a little further, and so on. Developing a good feel for what path to take next and how far to push is an important meta-level spiritual skill. The Direct Path never claims to be a complete spirituality in itself, but I wanted to point out that I don\u0026rsquo;t recommend it as a sole practice.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s completely valid, in fact, to ask why you would want to do nondual practice at all. Nondual practice often results in the loss of certain abilities you usually don\u0026rsquo;t have to think about, like depth perception and being able to identify where a sound is coming from when you hear it. This is, on one level, very cool, but it also seems pretty annoying and potentially unsafe once it becomes your default (imagine driving without depth perception). If you\u0026rsquo;re going to spend hundreds of hours working to lose patterns that are usually helpful, you should expect to get serious returns on your investment.\nWith enough practice, those returns should take the form of liberation. The idea (from a Buddhist perspective) is that once you\u0026rsquo;ve done enough nondual practice, you stop identifying with the random thoughts, emotions, and mental states you go through every day. This is different from dissociating from them! If your default is that these things are just arisings and not really yours, a lot of potentially problematic patterns can be interrupted all at once. This suggests that occasionally dissociating probably isn\u0026rsquo;t a bad thing, inasmuch as it\u0026rsquo;s good practice for not-associating - you just need to balance nondual practice against working with the content itself. There\u0026rsquo;s a lot to say about this, but I\u0026rsquo;ll restrain myself and instead point out that most people who get far enough into nondual practice that they start having weird sensory effects generally don\u0026rsquo;t complain that it wasn\u0026rsquo;t worth it (dark night is another story, though the general consensus seems to be that it can be avoided if you go slowly and carefully and have a good teacher).\nConclusion The Direct Path is a strange book. Overall, it\u0026rsquo;s been helpful to me and I\u0026rsquo;d recommend it to analytical-minded people who want to supplement an existing spiritual practice, but it seems to weirdly shoot itself in the foot in ways that would be particularly annoying to exactly those people. It makes weird cosmological claims and sometimes uses fuzzy reasoning in places where it could have just left out that paragraph without really losing anything. I\u0026rsquo;m left with the feeling that I\u0026rsquo;ve forced my own interpretation onto it and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit. But I ask myself: do I ever directly experience an intention from the author that contradicts my beliefs about the text? No? Well, then.\n"

                "body": "Selflessness and collectivism are not prerequisites for being a good person\nIndividualism I define individualism and collectivism as follows: individualists believe that you should do what is right and good for yourself, and collectivists believe you should do what is right and good for society/your in-group. I claim that you should be an individualist if and because it\u0026rsquo;s easier for you to be one, which I think should be the case for most people. I\u0026rsquo;ll address the exceptions first in hopes of demonstrating the rule.\nIn a few cases (pretty rare in the US), someone will grow up in a small, tight-knit community with the right cultural context that their identity is that they are a member of the community. I\u0026rsquo;d imagine this was the case in some (but not all) tribal cultures, but probably also happens occasionally for small towns and/or religious groups (I\u0026rsquo;m told this is common for Mennonites, for example). If this is you, embracing individualism will probably lead to worse short-term outcomes for you and maybe worse long-term outcomes too, because on top of having to rewrite your identity from scratch, you\u0026rsquo;ll have to learn the practical and social skills everyone else uses to exist in the world. Luckily, I suspect no Mennonites read my blog.\nIf you haven\u0026rsquo;t grown up such that being a member of a specific community is your identity, odds are that you basically conceive of yourself as an individual - and once you understand this, it\u0026rsquo;s an extremely hard thing to forget, which is why this blog is a memetic hazard to Mennonites. If, as an individual, you believe that you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be doing what\u0026rsquo;s right and good for society, you need some way to make yourself do what you\u0026rsquo;re supposed to be doing even when it doesn\u0026rsquo;t align with your interests. The psychological and social technologies for this usually target your fear of rejection (\u0026ldquo;if I don\u0026rsquo;t do thing, I\u0026rsquo;ll be a bad role (and people will like me less)\u0026rdquo;). This presents an obvious problem, which is that being a collectivist who thinks of themselves as an individual is only semi-stable: if your mental health improves to the point that you stop being sufficiently afraid of rejection, there isn\u0026rsquo;t enough external force keeping you in your role. You can keep playing it if you want to, but now you\u0026rsquo;re just doing what you think is right and good for yourself.\nAnd this is where individualism comes in. Individualism - or, more specifically, what I\u0026rsquo;ll call \u0026ldquo;skillful individualism\u0026rdquo; - is far more stable than collectivism, in that the only direction in which it\u0026rsquo;s unstable is the direction of transformative practice aimed at dissolving the individual. Skillful individualism is, for a vast majority of people, the final stage of a developmental progression I just made up:\nStage 1: egocenticity. Here you\u0026rsquo;re developmentally a child. The idea of needs or agendas more important than your own hasn\u0026rsquo;t sunk in for you yet, even if you understand it theoretically. Stage 2: (pseudo-)collectivism. You\u0026rsquo;ve understood the idea of a need more legitimate than your own, and you try to integrate yourself into some collective to serve your higher purpose. But if you understand yourself to be an individual, you probably have difficulty unlearning this - you are a pseudo-collectivist in that you can\u0026rsquo;t fully de-individuate and become an avatar of your cause/community. Stage 3: skillful individualism. You operate in groups because you like to, but are comfortable as an individual and no longer try to destroy your individual identity. You interact with needs and agendas beyond your own pragmatically: you try to advance causes you support while recognizing that you have a number of priorities to balance. Stage 4: lived nondual realization. You have had nondual realization and are able to live your life without relying on conceptualizing yourself as an individual. For the purposes of this post, I\u0026rsquo;m going to ignore stage 4 for now. The other stages might remind you of Kegan\u0026rsquo;s stages 1-4, which I discuss in my post on arrested development. From this perspective, \u0026ldquo;individualism\u0026rdquo; is at least a subset of \u0026ldquo;being able to reason about relationships\u0026rdquo; (Kegan stage 4). This might actually be a useful way to think about skillful individualism: it involves moving your relationships with others from a set of constraints (\u0026ldquo;I have to act within the bounds of these relationship templates\u0026rdquo;) to your metaphorical objective function (obviously, real life isn\u0026rsquo;t an optimization problem, so don\u0026rsquo;t take this too literally).\nAccordingly, skillful individualists still operate in groups. In fact, most of them probably spend significant amounts of time in group settings because that\u0026rsquo;s how humans operate: we love and need each other. To the extent that they want to (perhaps because they value the group or enjoy helping others), skillful individualists will even donate their time and resources to benefit the collective. In the same way, skillful individualism doesn\u0026rsquo;t preclude moral behavior, but rather provides the opportunity to establish your own moral standards. A skillful individualist does this because he realizes that promoting a community of flourishing, happy people is in his own self-interest. Eventually, the distinction between individualism and collectivism dissolves.\nSelfishness Selfishness is, in some ways, a specific case of the individualist/collectivist dynamic. The definition of selfishness is incredibly socially contingent and I\u0026rsquo;m not satisfied with the dictionary definitions. Wikipedia says, \u0026ldquo;Selfishness is being concerned excessively or exclusively, for oneself or one\u0026rsquo;s own advantage, pleasure, or welfare, regardless of others.\u0026rdquo; The problem with this is the implicit dualism of self-advantage and the well-being of others. If a skillful individualist, out of a desire to live in a clean neighborhood, picks up some litter, are they being selfish? Probably not in the way we typically mean the word, anyway.\nIn the podcast The Art of Accomplishment, Joe Hudson defines selfishness as \u0026ldquo;anything your parents told you was selfish when they wanted to control your behavior as a kid.\u0026rdquo; I think this is fair and gets at a good point, which is that the definition of selfishness we use in real life, the voice in our head that tells us we\u0026rsquo;re being selfish and are therefore bad, is usually based on some mental model of our parents. But we have a concept of selfishness for a reason: selfishness is used to describe behavior which ignores or bypasses social conventions designed to protect resources. Not picking up your dog\u0026rsquo;s poop is selfish, because cleaning up after yourself is mostly a social convention designed to protect common space. Stealing from someone is more or less selfish depending on the specific social conventions being broken; stealing a loaf of bread to feed your family is illegal, but not terribly selfish.\nNotice the distance between how we think of selfishness and the actual point of it. Having the impulse to avoid and/or punish selfishness prevents exploitation (to some degree), but for a lot of people their parent\u0026rsquo;s voice in their head goes way beyond just stopping them from gaming the system. Ever go to a restaurant and end up with the last piece of an appetizer sitting in the middle of the table until it\u0026rsquo;s eventually cleared away because everyone was too polite to take it? That\u0026rsquo;s value literally left sitting on the table because of your parents\u0026rsquo; voices in your heads.\nYoung children are selfish in impractical and unethical ways, because they don\u0026rsquo;t know any better and lack impulse control. You can think of the idea of selfishness as being something you install in children (more or less skillfully) to get them into the habit of considering others before they act. But once you\u0026rsquo;ve established your own ethics, the part of your mind that punishes perceived defection against imagined authority figures has outlived its usefulness and can only create problems. When I say that you should be selfish, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean that you should do things you think are morally wrong, I mean you should do things that you think are morally fine but activate that voice in your head. As you learn to stop being afraid of being selfish, to stop punishing yourself, you will become freer, lighter, and less stuck in your head.\n"

                "body": "On the Christian and nondual narratives around nature\nA few weeks ago, I participated in a conversation with about 15 other people about nature and spirituality, and saw an unusual pattern that I\u0026rsquo;d previously noticed myself falling into. People would say something like: \u0026ldquo;of course, humans are animals too, so we\u0026rsquo;re part of nature,\u0026rdquo; and then within moments would be talking about how humans are destroying nature. This repeated itself several times in several different people. Does it make sense to talk about nature destroying itself, or losing its relationship to itself? I think this is an instance of two different narratives being subconsciously merged.\nThe standard (in the US) narrative of human relationship to nature seems to go something like this: long ago, humans lived in harmony with nature. However, our greed and lack of wisdom led us to exploit it. Now, we risk destroying (or at least significantly harming) nature unless that greed and foolishness can be curbed.\nWhat I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize until a couple of hours after the conversation is how remarkably Christian this first narrative is - it\u0026rsquo;s about as close as you could imagine to being a secularized version of the Garden of Eden story. As a side note, this is an example of a very entertaining dance where the political left rejects Christian aesthetics while uncritically accepting Christian ideals, while the right does the exact opposite.\nThe other narrative being combined with the Christian story is the nondual story: that nature/not nature simply isn\u0026rsquo;t a useful distinction. Humans are animals and cities are biomes. If you completely accept this second story, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t make sense to talk about things like \u0026ldquo;conservation,\u0026rdquo; it makes sense to talk about what kind of environments you want to create.\nThe nondual narrative of human relationship to nature fits well with my heuristic belief that it\u0026rsquo;s generally better to accept that you have power and try to use it judiciously rather than try to wish it away - but does that heuristic apply here? First, I think it makes sense to talk about what \u0026ldquo;using power judiciously\u0026rdquo; actually means here. Very broadly, I mean it in the sense of deliberate interventions that create the sort of environments you want to see. In cities, for example, it seems pretty clear that people almost universally prefer more plants and walkability and less noise, so using power judiciously might look like having fewer, smaller streets, with the saved space going to community gardens and mixed-use zoning. In forests, judicious use of power might look like stricter regulation outlawing tree farms, while expanding and controlling selective logging. Or something. I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert in this and you probably shouldn\u0026rsquo;t pay much attention to my specific policy recommendations - but the idea in this example is that we recognize that logging is practically important and needs to happen to support US industry, while also making sure that it\u0026rsquo;s done in a way that doesn\u0026rsquo;t replace good environments (forests) with bad ones (tree farms).\nWith that said, there are a few reasons I can think of that you\u0026rsquo;d prefer a policy of \u0026ldquo;non-interference with nature\u0026rdquo; (having first decided that some places are nature) over trying to use environmental power judiciously. First is sacredness: if unadultarated nature has some spiritual quality that\u0026rsquo;s destroyed by human interference, you obviously wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to mess with it. Next is epistemic humility: can we be sure that any changes we make to nature are actually wise? Finally, there\u0026rsquo;s politics: who gets to decide what changes are good? I think the points of sacredness and humility are actually pretty reasonable, but I\u0026rsquo;d be pretty satisfied on these fronts if we set aside relatively small amounts of land that we\u0026rsquo;ll try to conserve (basically: national parks). We might eventually determine that we know enough about promoting good environments that we no longer have to hedge against our ability to do so, but this seems like it\u0026rsquo;s a long way off to me.\nThe last point, politics, raises the valid concern that incentives may not always be aligned when deliberately modifying the environment. For instance, global warming might turn Siberia into arable farmland while destroying US agriculture, which creates an obvious conflict of interest. You can\u0026rsquo;t just make a rule like \u0026ldquo;no global changes without UN consensus\u0026rdquo; or something, because local changes might have global effects: reforesting the Sahara desert would probably affect the health of the Amazon rainforest. And as anyone who\u0026rsquo;s tracked any attempt at building infrastructure in the US knows, environmental impact assessments are the work of Moloch and to be avoided when possible, at least in their current form. But the fact that it can be hard to agree on what is good doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a good reason to do nothing, especially when we\u0026rsquo;re already making global environmental changes.\nA final point here is that the nondual narrative integrates better with the fact that even in the most strictly conserved areas, humans make deliberate interventions to manage the ecosystem. We deliberately reintroduced gray wolves to Yellowstone - a true policy of noninterference would not have permitted this. A more cleverly phrased \u0026ldquo;minimize the effects of human interference\u0026rdquo; gets you out of this, but raises the obvious question of how to quantify the effects of human interference in a single quantity that we can minimize. There are other examples, too: when Iceland wanted to restore their forests, they discovered that native tree species no longer grew well due to climate change (Iceland was deforested by Vikings about a thousand years ago). So they imported non-native trees from Alaska. This seems like a pretty clear-cut case of ecosystem engineering to me: a habitat that\u0026rsquo;s existed for a thousand years is replaced by a completely different one composed of species from the other side of the planet. But I don\u0026rsquo;t find it problematic, either - the new forests will be beautiful and diverse and help stop erosion. The nondual narrative seems to integrate this better than the Christian one.\nWhat I want to advocate in this essay is a relaxation of the boundaries we put around what we care about and how. It\u0026rsquo;s obviously important to protect the commons from overexploitation, but I think at least as much harm has been done by well-intentioned incompetence as by greed. Take a look at the mistakes being made around you and what\u0026rsquo;s being done to correct them, and figure out where you can effect the greatest marginal change. Is that by agitating against strip mining? If so, great! But there\u0026rsquo;s a decent chance it\u0026rsquo;s by agitating against noise pollution or dumb zoning laws - and that\u0026rsquo;s also great! The latter items might not seem like they\u0026rsquo;re as important, but the marginal change you can make there might be greater and more durable than what you can do in \u0026ldquo;standard\u0026rdquo; environmental activism.\nAnyway, this is mostly just fun stuff to think about - at the end of the day, doing anything is probably better than doing nothing, unless the thing you\u0026rsquo;re doing is bad and harmful, so I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to try and help with something on the grounds that it\u0026rsquo;s not the literal most effective thing I could be doing. I\u0026rsquo;ve found thinking nondually about the environment to be useful because it lets me worry more broadly and less deeply, so I see more opportunities to do good and feel less anxiety about the future. Maybe it will work for you too!\n"

                "body": "Robert Kegan on development and Venkatesh Rao on where it stops\nA number of psychologists have advanced theories of developmental psychology. Freud\u0026rsquo;s is strange and probably wrong, but he had one. Piaget\u0026rsquo;s is fairly famous, but we\u0026rsquo;re interested in adult development here. I\u0026rsquo;m going to take a little detour to explain Kegan\u0026rsquo;s stages of development as I understand them, because the first several search results I found were really bad. In each stage, you\u0026rsquo;re capable of reasoning about some things (meaning that you have \u0026ldquo;free will\u0026rdquo; in these areas - you generally have the ability to think out problems and respond in a non-mechanical way), and you\u0026rsquo;re subject to other things (you can\u0026rsquo;t or don\u0026rsquo;t have a habit of reasoning about them). In Kegan\u0026rsquo;s theory, development is about gaining the ability to reason about more and more domains.\nStage 1. You\u0026rsquo;re a baby. I don\u0026rsquo;t really remember this one or care very much about it. You\u0026rsquo;re a baby, you do baby things. To maintain the pattern, I guess you\u0026rsquo;re subject to impulses and perceptions?\nStage 2. Subject to needs \u0026amp; desires, reasons about impulses and perceptions\nStage 3. Subject to relationships, reasons about needs and desires\nStage 4. Subject to identity and ideology, reasons about relationships\nStage 5. Subject to dialogue between ideologies/metasystematicity, reasons about identity and ideology\nYou can use surveys to figure out which stage someone is at; only like 1% of adults are at stage 5.\nAdult development makes an unexpected appearance in The Gervais Principle by Venkatesh Rao, which was supposed to be about organizational behavior. The whole book is worth reading - Rao\u0026rsquo;s cynicism is, if nothing else, extremely entertaining, and it works well to make sure you don\u0026rsquo;t romanticize the workplace. But in the middle of the book, it shifts from being about organizational dynamics and starts talking about developmental psychology. As Rao points out, he is not a psychologist and isn\u0026rsquo;t advancing a clinical theory - and I\u0026rsquo;d add that Rao is in the business of advancing deliberately contraversial ideas that are at best directionally correct. In other words, how seriously you take any of this is up to you.\nRao splits people into three categories (noting that in reality, people don\u0026rsquo;t fall into them neatly but probably have elements of all three): Clueless, Losers, and Sociopaths. These names are deliberately insulting (to get you to read more) and don\u0026rsquo;t actually describe the groups they\u0026rsquo;re attached to very well. Rao says that he uses them because his book was inspired by a comic and he likes the joke too much to give it up; I\u0026rsquo;m now using them because I can\u0026rsquo;t talk about the book otherwise.\nThe Clueless are the least developed group. They crave approval, so they\u0026rsquo;re genuinely motivated by inherently worthless awards from authority figures (eg: employee of the month, getting a sticker from the teacher). They approximately map to Kegan stages 2 and 3 depending on where they are in their development. Their reliance on legible \u0026ldquo;status red herrings\u0026rdquo; is exacerbated by the fact that they don\u0026rsquo;t reason about relationships (which would be stage 4) The Losers, according to Rao, comprise the vast majority of people, and approximately map to Kegan stages 3 and 4. All Losers want their self-image validated by others, and they form groups for the purpose of mutual appreciation. Losers deliberately create illegibility around social status within their groups so that no one\u0026rsquo;s self-image is threatened; being a good artist isn\u0026rsquo;t comparable with being a good writer. The Sociopaths are a subset of Kegan stage 5. Specifically, Sociopaths are stage 5 people who take on the role of managing other people\u0026rsquo;s realities for them. The Clueless and the Losers rely on self-deception (for Losers, it\u0026rsquo;s more like mutual deception that everyone agrees not to squint too hard at), and Sociopaths accept power from them in exchange for smoothing over irregularities in their illusions. Here\u0026rsquo;s the important thing about Rao\u0026rsquo;s theory: he thinks you get stuck in one of these categories due to your strengths. The basics of this, from the book:\nYour development is arrested by your strengths, not your weaknesses Arrested-development behavior is caused by a strength-based addiction The mediocre develop faster than either the talented or the untalented In other words, if you\u0026rsquo;re good at school and don\u0026rsquo;t have some pressure to be good at social stuff, you\u0026rsquo;ll just keep being good at school. Yes, you eventually run out of school, but it takes a long time to do that, especially if you go all the way to a PhD, and by then it\u0026rsquo;s way harder to learn Loser skills than it ever would have been in high school. It\u0026rsquo;s much easier to squint at everything until it looks vaguely schoolish - and that\u0026rsquo;s how you end up vying for employee of the month. PhDs can be Clueless.\nOn the other hand, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re not quite good enough at school to consistently use it to make yourself feel good. In fact, maybe you\u0026rsquo;re not good enough at anything to consistently win at that thing, or you\u0026rsquo;re in an environment where winning too much makes people dislike you. If you want to feel good, you\u0026rsquo;re forced to learn Loser skills.\nI\u0026rsquo;m not really sure what the typical pathway is from Kegan stage 4 to 5, but Rao\u0026rsquo;s theory suggests that it has something to do with mediocrity - maybe you find that you\u0026rsquo;re not good enough at being a Loser (you keep wanting things to be legible or discover that staying in your lane doesn\u0026rsquo;t make you feel good or something). I think this is probably wrong - most of the stage 5 people I\u0026rsquo;ve met are smart enough to do really well in school and socially skilled enough to have plenty of friends. I think the transition today has a lot to do with ambition and agency. There aren\u0026rsquo;t any systems or institutions that seem to be designed to get people to stage 5, so only the ones who keep pushing on their own make it. If we want to twist this a little so Rao is still sort of right: the sort of person who ends up at stage 5 might have been good at the object-level games of stages 3 and 4, but was bad at extracting contentment from them.\nThe useful takeaway from this part of the book is that it\u0026rsquo;s important to be a little bit suspicious of the things you\u0026rsquo;re good at. Even if you\u0026rsquo;re already at Kegan stage 5, I think this keeps going: are you using your ability to be right more often than other people to feed your ego instead of deconstructing yourself or making other spritual/emotional progress? If you\u0026rsquo;ve made some good spiritual progress, are you sure you\u0026rsquo;re not doing any spiritual bypassing (cf: Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism)? And I suspect the list goes on. You could say that all of this is still just stage 5 and you\u0026rsquo;re just getting asymptotically better at being metasystematic, that\u0026rsquo;s fine too - it\u0026rsquo;s just important to observe the difference between an asymptote and a hard stop.\nAs I\u0026rsquo;m done with this essay and don\u0026rsquo;t know how to finish it, I\u0026rsquo;ll offer this sentence as an example of a hard stop.\n"

I\u0026rsquo;ve only read a few hundred pages of it, but it basically takes the form of a series of relatively short and deeply unreadable pieces of literary/artistic criticism, mostly centering around the subject of desire. The book is, conservatively, 40% footnotes - the first page ends with an 8-page footnote, and shortly later there\u0026rsquo;s a footnote getting upset with you, the reader, for wanting fewer footnotes. The book is written as a sort of polemic, but it\u0026rsquo;s a polemic against you for being awful.\nI found this review by Jim Nelson, who also hasn\u0026rsquo;t read the book, to be really helpful as I try to understand it. The author of Sadly, Porn, who goes by Edward Teach, claims that the content of our desires is irrelevant - it\u0026rsquo;s the form that\u0026rsquo;s important. He then goes on to claim that we aren\u0026rsquo;t even capable of having desires. Nelson thinks that Teach is driving at a similar underlying point as W.H. Auden, who drew a distinction between desires and wishes. Nelson offers a simplification: \u0026ldquo;A wish is the simple act of imagining oneself as a different person, or in a different situation; a desire is imagining how one might convert one’s current self into a different person or situation. A wish is wanting to be thin; a desire is vowing to join a gym and work-out every day (even if one doesn’t act on it).\u0026rdquo; For Auden, wishes are rooted in a rejection of the self, and desires are rooted in acceptance of the self.\nI think this is a very good first pass, and it approaches a few points in the book that I want to break down. First, though I don\u0026rsquo;t see Teach draw the same firm distinction that Auden did, he thinks that people fear any desire or fantasy which is geniunely theirs, because having a desire of your own means that you have some responsibility for it. This seems to be a sort of continuous generalization of Auden\u0026rsquo;s idea in that the more room your desire leaves for personal agency, the more responsible you naturally become for it.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve done a little bit of elision with the word responsible, because you can be responsible to external forces or responsible to yourself - and this was intentional, because I think Teach intends both meanings at the same time. It\u0026rsquo;s fairly obvious how you could be responsible to others for your desires: if they think you want the wrong things, or if you want the right things but seem to be unable to get them, they might lose respect for you. Along similar lines, one of the ideas in Sadly, Porn is \u0026ldquo;pretending high status to oneself\u0026rdquo;: you want to believe that you have high status among your peers, but status is often illegible. This is good, because it allows you to pretend high status to yourself - the only thing that might get in the way of doing that is if you were presented with evidence of low status too often. From here we have a jump due to Goodhart: since status itself is illegible, \u0026ldquo;evidence of low status\u0026rdquo; gets unconsciously subtituted out for \u0026ldquo;evidence of appearance of low status.\u0026rdquo; In other words, we can continue to pretend high status to ourselves as long as we don\u0026rsquo;t risk looking low-status to ourselves when we take what we think is an outside view.\nA good example of the desire/wish continuum and where Teach thinks we want to be on it: \u0026ldquo;you don\u0026rsquo;t want to ask out the pretty girl, you want her to trip so you\u0026rsquo;re forced to catch her.\u0026rdquo; We want things to work out such that we get what we want, without us exerting any obvious effort or incurring any risk of failure in getting there - ideally, we don\u0026rsquo;t even make any choices. In fact, Teach thinks that we prefer not to risk even having unique, specific fantasies of our own. My experience seems to confirm this: I\u0026rsquo;ve met a lot of people who are ambitious in a vague sort of way, in that they\u0026rsquo;ll gravitate towards things that are generally prestigious and even work hard to get those things (eg: promotions, leadership roles, scholarships, well-regarded universities, money), but I pretty seldom meet people who have ambition, in that there\u0026rsquo;s something specific about how they want the world to look in the future and they are working towards that goal.\nIn lieu of having desires of our own, Teach thinks we adopt the desires of others. I want the money and the hot girl, but only because other people want them too. People like to point out that attractiveness is socially contingent and usually changes to track indicators of wealth. The obvious fact that gets left out is that the mechanism for picking up your aesthetics from your peers is much simpler than learning to want rich people and then learning proxies for wealth: you just learn to want the things everyone else wants, and you minimize the risks of being responsible for wanting those things by fantasizing about getting them instead of making concrete plans.\nThe more desire you have in an area, the less comfortable you are with admitting agency in that area. Even people in positions of power usually pretend (to most of us) that they don\u0026rsquo;t have desires/ambitions within their sphere of influence; they instead have some higher calling or external rationality that compels their actions, and thus absolves them of responsibility. They can fail (spiritually or rationally) to act correctly according to their external driver, but are never responsible for what they want because they get to disavow wanting things entirely.\nPsychopolitics Where there are people looking to dump agency, there\u0026rsquo;s profit and influence to be gained by becoming someone who\u0026rsquo;s willing to accept it. On an individual level, Venkatesh Rao would call these people Sociopaths - his views dovetail so well with Teach\u0026rsquo;s that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem worth elaborating on here, but you can read The Gervais Principle or this Ribbonfarm post to get the flavor (he overloads the word to describe a specific role in interpersonal and workplace dynamics). But it\u0026rsquo;s also worth looking at how this effect is exploited systematically, and for this I want to talk about Byung-Chul Han\u0026rsquo;s Psychopolitics.\nPsychopolitics is a book on neoliberal governmentality, which is a fancy way of saying \u0026ldquo;how the state gets you to do things.\u0026rdquo; As generations of feudal lords have learned, people tend to do the bare minimum when governed at swordpoint, and sometimes they do unfortunate things like revolting and deposing you. Ideally, you would find a way to get people to want to do the things you want them to do, which makes them work harder and revolt less. Psychopolitics claims that modern neoliberal states (the state includes, but isn\u0026rsquo;t limited to, the government) accomplish this by indoctrinating people to think of themselves as projects rather than subjects - that is, people are made to believe that anything is possible for them if they work a little harder to make themselves a little better. In other words, they are seduced into thinking of themselves as capital, and working endlessly to exploit themselves such that the state never has to apply overt coersion.\nMany of the claims in Psychopolitics appear to be directly opposite Sadly, Porn (to the extent that Sadly, Porn makes consistent claims at all, that is - but I\u0026rsquo;ll proceed taking my interpretations as canon): where Teach thinks we\u0026rsquo;re too afraid to even be responsible for our desires, Han thinks we constantly exploit ourselves in service of getting what we want (or, more accurately, that we\u0026rsquo;ve been trained to approach ourselves as things to be exploited - Psychopolitics is a bit short on concrete claims and supporting evidence). If people really did view themselves as projects and constantly work to improve themselves, I\u0026rsquo;d expect to see them being generally more successful in most areas of their lives. One obvious example is obesity: addressing your obesity is a ridiculously effective health intervention, and most popular diets do actually work if followed (at least in the short-term), so you wouldn\u0026rsquo;t expect high rates of obesity unless people didn\u0026rsquo;t follow their diets (or if there was some external driver of obesity like environmental contaminants or widespread metabolic issues requiring specific types of intervention). But Psychopolitics doesn\u0026rsquo;t require that people are successful in their self-exploitation, only that it becomes second nature to them. In fact, psychopolitics works better when people are moderately unsuccessful at exploiting themselves, because too much success risks people becoming enlightened enough to disengage with the system.\nOne of the ideas in Psychopolitics is the \u0026ldquo;digital panopticon.\u0026rdquo; The digital panopticon builds on Bentham\u0026rsquo;s idea of the panopticon, in which prisoners who never know whether they are being observed by guards learn to police their own behavior. In the digital panopticon, we voluntarily reveal ourselves to the world (mostly via social media) and serve as guards to each other. The digital panopticon exerts an powerful levelling influence by making social status extremely legible and then gamifying it. When we always feel that we\u0026rsquo;re on display to the entire world (even if we think of that as a good thing), the idea of being responsible for our desires becomes still more threatening. Which means we become more willing to surrender agency around things we want, which means we\u0026rsquo;re less likely to get them, which means they can be dangled in front of us as carrots indefinitely.\nConclusion Sadly, Porn is about how we sabotage ourselves and others, ultimately (to my reading) out of fear of aloneness or rejection. Psychpolitics provides an interesting lens on how this effect is systematically exploited to turn people into units of production while collaborating with them to prevent any benefit of their productivity from accruing to themselves.\nThis essay has been mostly my opinions anyway, but in the spirit of taking responsibility for what I want: I think you should probably get some ambitions (if you already have some and they seem good to you, that is an excellent and unusual thing and I\u0026rsquo;m rooting for you). If you\u0026rsquo;re looking for a place to start: elsewhere in the blog, I\u0026rsquo;ve endorsed working out as a self-development practice; I\u0026rsquo;ll reiterate that here. It seems like seeing the results of regular hard work over a longish period of time is really good for self-efficacy (aside from the normal health benefits), which will give you a boost towards being more ambitious.\nAnd speaking of, I think most people should probably be generally more ambitious, too. I\u0026rsquo;ve personally shied away from the idea of being ambitious in the past because ambitious people always seemed to end up doing business school or consulting or working for Facebook or something and I really didn\u0026rsquo;t want to end up there. If that resonates for you: just get better ambitions than those people, don\u0026rsquo;t use them as an excuse to do nothing. If you\u0026rsquo;re already generally ambitious, but don\u0026rsquo;t have specific ambitions (as in, you just want to be rich or something): you\u0026rsquo;re halfway there, and you can do better by thinking about what you want the world to be like and why you want that.\nIf you can find them, I think you should make friends with some friendly, ambitious nerds (friendly nerds with ambitions?) and consider helping them out if they have good ideas they want to try (cf: microsolidarity; this doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be monetary if you can\u0026rsquo;t afford that, sometimes feedback or introductions to the right people are just as good as or better than funding). Helping other people do something big means that you\u0026rsquo;ve already done part of something big, and they\u0026rsquo;ll be more likely to help you when you have an idea. And, being around ambitious people will naturally make you more ambitious.\nAfter reading part of Sadly, Porn, I\u0026rsquo;ve occasionally redirected daydreaming about outcomes to daydreaming about processes. I\u0026rsquo;ve also noticed that I\u0026rsquo;ve started biasing more towards trying things and taking risks that I might have been too scared to take before. I don\u0026rsquo;t know if that relationship is causal, but it would be an interesting experiment to run!\nUnfortunately, due to the sheer amount of irrelevant material, I can\u0026rsquo;t really recommend either of these books, but they definitely changed the way I think. If you decide to read them: good luck. If you finish, write a review for the rest of us.\n"

                "body": "Filtering out indoor air pollution is the highest leverage one-time health intervention\nCredit for doing good research on air quality and blogging about it goes to Dynomight, I just want to boost their ideas. You should read the original post, but a brief summary of the problem it presents is: when you breathe in tiny particles, they make you more likely to get cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and other things you don\u0026rsquo;t want. Dynomight looks at several countries, and if you\u0026rsquo;re in India or China, you really, really need to get an air filter, because ambient air pollution is the single most impactful factor they found for increasing your lifespan. But I\u0026rsquo;m in the US - am I OK? Sort of - cities in the US are less polluted than cities in India and China, but Dynomight still finds that if I\u0026rsquo;m not on drugs or drinking, air pollution is second only to high BMI as a health risk (as measured by disability-adjusted life-years per year).\nFortunately, PM2.5 sensors are pretty cheap, so I got one on Amazon and took some measurements. I initially got very bad news: the ambient indoor PM2.5 readings were on par with some of the world\u0026rsquo;s most polluted cities! Fortunately, a friend pointed out that this was probably a mistake, and I realized that I had misread the sensor\u0026rsquo;s spec. I fixed the problem and found that the indoor air quality in my apartment was pretty good! But Dynomight finds a pretty consistent linear relationship between DALY (disability-adjusted life-year) deficit and air pollution even at low levels, so I bought an air filter. As Dynomight points out, this is a ridiculously high-leverage intervention: it\u0026rsquo;s pretty much guaranteed to improve air quality, and it sure looks like that will extend your life. By how much? My apartment had a baseline level of 8 ug/m^3. Dynomight gives two useful ways to measure effect of PM2.5 exposure:\nYou lose 1 additional hour of DALY per hour exposed to PM2.5 levels of 2500 ug/m^3 You lose 1 DALY over your lifetime if your average PM2.5 exposure is 33.3 ug/m^3. Let\u0026rsquo;s say I spend around 16 hours a day in my apartment (this, sadly, is probably an underestimate). Over the course of a year, I expect to lose 16 * 365 * 8 / 2500 = 18 life-hours as a result of this exposure level. Over my lifetime, this means I can hope to lose something like a month and a half off my lifespan due to indoor air pollution, assuming I never move. Or I can buy this back for less than $100. This is why the air filter is so ridiculously worth the expense. I got the IKEA Fornuftig filter, which is extraordinarily quiet on its lowest setting and reduced the PM2.5 count to zero on my sensor. Nice!\nCooking Unfortunately, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t all I learned from my sensor. See, I thought it would be pretty slick to get it to to a live plot of the raw particle counts. So I set it running, did some work, and made dinner.\nAh, shit\nIn order, here is what happens in the graph: the relatively small bump is me as I start cooking. The huge spike comes from me opening the door to my office. Then I turned my filter all the way up and it starts to decay, but I get curious and bring the sensor into the kitchen, where the particle count achieves its maximum value. I then bring the sensor back to the office and close the door. Please note that the y-axis here is RAW COUNTS, NOT ug/m^3, so the graph isn\u0026rsquo;t as bad as it looks. The value in ug/m^3 in the kitchen was around 500 though, so still quite bad, and it took 3 hours to come down to normal. I estimate that cooking dinner cost me something like 20 life-minutes (from pollution - it would be weird, though not inaccurate, to add the time I spent cooking to this). I should note here that I was frying tofu, which produces more smoke than most cooking, but this is potentially very significant! Cooking dinner was equivalent to several days of ambient indoor air pollution. If I cooked like this every night, I would lose 5 life-days a year purely from the particulate matter.\nThis is interesting because it suggests that indoor air pollution follows a Pareto distribution - in this case, before the filter, 81% of the particles I inhaled each day came from 12.5% of the time (the three hours following whenever I start to cook). Malcom Gladwell has a good piece somewhere on Pareto problems (he calls them \u0026ldquo;long-tail problems\u0026rdquo;), where he suggests that any time you see a Pareto problem, you\u0026rsquo;re lucky, because you can basically concentrate all of your efforts in one place and get significant results for (hopefully) a fraction of what solving the entire problem would cost you. The obvious solution to generating too much PM while cooking is to cook outside as much as possible, perhaps wearing a mask when you have to stand right over the grill. Failing that, I ran a very informal experiment with my microwave fume hood (mounted right above the stovetop). Dynomight helpfully informs us that Kang et. al. tried the fume hood on its own and found an 86% reduction in peak PM2.5! I observed similar effects: when I cooked again the next night, I used the fume hood and particle count was down \u0026gt;90% (although I was cooking something different and less smoky, so there\u0026rsquo;s a confounding variable here).\nFinal thoughts\nUnless you have excellent reason to believe that your indoor air isn\u0026rsquo;t polluted, a PM2.5 sensor and air filter are ridiculously well-worth the investment. A filter is probably the most effective one-off intervention you can perform to improve your healthspan. Regardless of whether you get a filter, you can improve your health significantly by using the fume hood above your stove while cooking, if you have one. "

                "body": "Why I don\u0026rsquo;t think it makes sense to try to be authentic\nnb: This piece is almost entirely unoriginal. I wrote it because I wish I had read something like it years ago/I think the idea ought to spread more widely. It\u0026rsquo;s also going to be a little Buddhist-heavy. I\u0026rsquo;ve decided not to include any Pali/Sanskrit/Tibetan terms, because I suspect I don\u0026rsquo;t grasp the full meanings associated with any of them and don\u0026rsquo;t want to create confusion for someone who goes on to do \u0026ldquo;real Buddhism.\u0026rdquo;\nIn Buddhism, one of the key aspects of enlightenment is a quality of lightness and freedom that allows you to be deeply responsive to your context. We can gesture towards factors of responsiveness:\nYou can\u0026rsquo;t be responsive to a situation if you\u0026rsquo;ve misunderstood it. To recognize what\u0026rsquo;s actually happening around you, you first have to be present. This means you need to be present to the situation itself, not your feelings about it or concepts related to it. Presence is a big part of what you\u0026rsquo;re trying to cultivate in most kinds of meditation (like noting or most breath work). Once you know what is happening, you have to understand the appropriate way to relate to your environment. The ability to determine how one should adapt to a particular context is often called \u0026ldquo;skillfulness,\u0026rdquo; and it has a number of factors: you need to be aligned, open to your full range of emotional experiences, and willing to let go of your preconceptions about how you (or people in general, or any in-group) typically react to situations like this one. Good practices for this are parts work and somatic practices. Having understood the correct mode of relationship or course of action, you then need to actually make it happen. Obviously this can be hard, and can require apparently inflexible qualities like courage or discipline. I don\u0026rsquo;t know of any good classical practices for this - my guess is something like working out is probably pretty decent? Alignment is also really helpful here, it\u0026rsquo;s pretty unusual that you\u0026rsquo;ll run into a situation where you know something is appropriate but don\u0026rsquo;t want to do it if you\u0026rsquo;re well-aligned. An important tool for figuring out the best way to relate to your context is the realization of not-self. When you have realized not-self, you don\u0026rsquo;t automatically view situations from the reference point of your own ego (so an angry remark, for example, parses as a sign of someone hurting somehow instead of as a potential threat). You also don\u0026rsquo;t need to limit your potential responses to a situation by running them through a \u0026ldquo;is this something I would do\u0026rdquo; filter. So not-self helps you understand both what\u0026rsquo;s happening and how to respond.\nI bring up not-self because I want to talk about authenticity. In the past, I\u0026rsquo;ve understood authenticity to mean something like \u0026ldquo;acting in a way that\u0026rsquo;s congruent with who you truly are.\u0026rdquo; I now think this is a bad thing to strive for and I hope this helps some reader to figure it out faster than I did. \u0026ldquo;Who you truly are\u0026rdquo; implies a self in all the ways that are likely to make you less responsive. If you\u0026rsquo;re being who you truly are, you misunderstand situations that activate your particular traumas, aversions, or desires. You also decide how to do things based on how your conceptualized version of yourself behaves in similarly encoded situations. This makes authenticity a tricky value to navigate.\nGenerally, I think the idea of being authentic can probably be replaced with more useful models, but if you\u0026rsquo;re attached to it, I think you can make it work if you interpret it differently than I did. I don\u0026rsquo;t see any problem, for example, with being authentic to your moral values, as long as you\u0026rsquo;re willing to hold the values themselves loosely enough that you can change them if they end up being wrong. I also think it often makes sense to be authentic to significant aspects of your emotional or phenomenological experience (with usual caveats about working within cultural and social contexts).\nThe last thing I\u0026rsquo;d add here is that I\u0026rsquo;m not trying to say that authenticity itself is bad. When I percieve someone as authentic, the signs of that \u0026ldquo;from the outside\u0026rdquo; seem to be something like honesty and congruence, which are both traits I value. The flipside of the \u0026ldquo;targeting authenticity will hurt your responsiveness\u0026rdquo; model is that you don\u0026rsquo;t have to target authenticity, because autheticity is a bundle of traits that make more sense to target individually. If you spend your time trying to become more aligned and developing factors that promote honesty, my intuition is that you will naturally become more authentic (as percieved by others) without nearly as much risk of losing responsiveness.\n"

                "body": "Against a more-than-usually-persuasive argument for eating meat\nI was reading Erik Hoel\u0026rsquo;s substack and found an interesting argument on vegetarianism:\nImagine a dystopian future in which aliens with a taste for human flesh kidnapped a bunch of people from Earth and raised them as livestock on their alien planet. Humans on the alien planet are kept alive “free-range,” able to interact and live their life, but only for their first 20 years. Then they are harvested for food.\nIf you were an alien politician concerned about the ethical mistreatment of humans, would you advocate for (a) the continuation of the system but with better treatment for humans (quicker death, better living conditions, longer life), or (b) to stop the system entirely, although this would mean that humans would soon die out in one generation as they’d be unable to survive on the alien planet. Quick, which would you advocate: (a) or (b)?\nFor many of the animals we eat, we’d be consigning their species to oblivion if we stopped eating them\u0026hellip; My intuition is they’d probably choose to be born, and eventually eaten, rather than not be born at all.\nWhen I went to college and met for the first time a good number of vegetarians and vegans, I used to blow their minds with this argument—“Oh, so you say you love cows, but you also want to consign their species to oblivion?” Despite its overblown and somewhat jokey nature no one ever gave me a good counterargument. So I never stopped eating meat.\nI thought it would be interesting to look a little more closely at this, but I have two quick disclaimers: first, I like Erik Hoel and his substack, which probably won\u0026rsquo;t come through that well because I don\u0026rsquo;t think much of this argument. Second, though I do still eat meat on occasion, I\u0026rsquo;d say less than one of my meals in a given week has any meat, and even then it\u0026rsquo;s more like a slice of pork in a bowl of ramen than a steak. So I\u0026rsquo;d probably identify more with vegetarians than with carnivores - do with that as you will.\nBefore I actually deal with the argument here, I\u0026rsquo;d like to briefly digress and say that arguments of this type tend to annoy me, because the implicit claim is that you\u0026rsquo;re eating meat because of some clever argument, when you clearly thought it up as an ex post facto justification. When I ate meat regularly, I didn\u0026rsquo;t try to pretend it was an ethical thing to do. It was an unethical thing that I did because I wanted to do it. People are allowed to not be perfect, but justifications like this are a pet peeve of mine because they seem like such a profound misuse of intelligence. Again, this isn\u0026rsquo;t meant to be a knock on Erik Hoel, it\u0026rsquo;s just that this one particular thing he wrote doesn\u0026rsquo;t sit well with me.\nOK, I\u0026rsquo;m done ranting. When an argument is well-written and persuasive, I like to break it down into a list to deal with it:\n(Approximately) per Kant, we should behave according to principles that we would want everyone to adopt. The lives of hypothetical future livestock deserve moral consideration If people universally stopped eating meat or significantly reduced their meat consumption, livestock populations would fall, which corresponds to a destruction of hypothetical future livestock This argument already looks pretty shaky to me. Hoel\u0026rsquo;s argument boils down to \u0026ldquo;we need to buy meat to fund factories that maximize livestock production.\u0026rdquo; This means that for any amount of funding, the most ethical thing to do with it is raise the maximum breeding population you can sustain, then get them to produce as many offspring as possible, euthanizing most of the babies (except those that will form the next generation of the breeding population). Any other choice counterfactually kills animals that \u0026ldquo;would probably choose to be born.\u0026rdquo; The fact that you\u0026rsquo;re killing them anyway doesn\u0026rsquo;t matter, according to Hoel - the important thing is maximizing number of births. This doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like a good ethical system to me.\nI could also point out that if, as Hoel seems to imply, humans and livestock deserve equal moral consideration (more on this later), we have the duty to breed humans, meaning that birth control of any sort, including through abstinence, is immoral (in fact, this works even if humans deserve greater moral consideration - think of the hypothetical babies you\u0026rsquo;re killing with all the sex you\u0026rsquo;re not having). I could even combine the two arguments: imagine the utopia you could create by combining constant unprotected sex with a pre-commitment to killing most babies as soon as they\u0026rsquo;re born. Any takers?\nAnother weird aspect of Hoel\u0026rsquo;s argument is that, above a moral duty to eat meat, it implies a moral duty to donate to livestock farmers. Surely they could raise more animals in better conditions if they didn\u0026rsquo;t have to incur the overhead of killing, butchering, packing, and shipping them - and I\u0026rsquo;m sure that\u0026rsquo;s not the whole supply chain. This isn\u0026rsquo;t an argument that eating meat is bad any more than effective altruism is an argument that donating to museums is bad, but I think it\u0026rsquo;s fair to say that anyone who claims to be eating meat based on Hoel\u0026rsquo;s argument is, by their own claimed values, behaving very inefficiently if they don\u0026rsquo;t donate money to livestock farmers.\nHoel\u0026rsquo;s argument cleverly implies by its initial analogy that there is some level of moral equivalence between livestock and humans. This makes it a lot more convincing at a surface level, because the idea of humans going extinct is scary, so we feel less comfortable with the idea of letting cows go extinct when the two ideas are tied together. But most people would agree that humans deserve greater moral consideration than cattle - under what circumstances would you be willing to eat a person, as opposed to a steak? This opens up space to examine alternatives to large-scale livestock farming more closely.\nLivestock farming is significantly less space-efficient per calorie than farming produce, so when you think about large-scale replacement of livestock farming with produce farming, you have to consider that huge tracts of land will presumably, over a few hundred years, revert from farmland to biodiverse habitats appropriate to the relevant biome (grassland, old-growth forest, etc). Let\u0026rsquo;s say the land would eventually revert to being a forest. I\u0026rsquo;d argue that the hypothetical inhabitants of that forest deserve equal moral consideration to hypothetical future livestock. Or, to think of it another way: what if I told you that a new cow species had been discovered that was more resistant to disease and tasted better than the ones we have now? Would you have any problem phasing out the old cow species for the new one? I\u0026rsquo;m sure this has happened several times without triggering a moral crisis - but this situation is pretty much equivalent to replacement of farms with forests, except the new breed of cow is a bunch of wild animals.\nWe can also attack the Kantian aspect of Hoel\u0026rsquo;s argument: the reality is that everyone isn\u0026rsquo;t going to adopt my principles. I\u0026rsquo;d be very surprised if 20% of the US population ever becomes vegetarian on principle. As an individual person who can\u0026rsquo;t make anyone else\u0026rsquo;s choices, my options are:\nFund an institution that brutally tortures animals for years until eventually killing them Pay more money for ethically raised meat (and invest time to figure out what, if any, meat is ethically sourced) Hunt for my meat Eat other things Unlike the politician in Hoel\u0026rsquo;s hypothetical, I don\u0026rsquo;t have a \u0026ldquo;destroy the livestock industry\u0026rdquo; option any more than I have a \u0026ldquo;reform the livestock industry\u0026rdquo; option. I can choose to participate in systematic torture or not. Usually I opt not to; sometimes the pork dumpings at the restaurant look too good to resist. But I don\u0026rsquo;t convince myself that I\u0026rsquo;m doing something noble by eating them.\n"

                "body": "If you saw a ghost, would you believe in it?\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been asking friends (and a couple of strangers) questions about ghosts. Specifically, I had these questions:\nIf you saw a ghost, would you start believing in ghosts, or would you think you were hallucinating? Let\u0026rsquo;s say you go to a psychiatrist and they tell you that based on your experience of seeing ghosts, they think you might have condition X, which very rarely presents any danger to you or others. However, they can offer you some medication to stop you from seeing ghosts, if you want. Do you take it? Let\u0026rsquo;s assume the ghost seldom talks to you, but when it does, it tells you things that you didn\u0026rsquo;t know and that usually turn out to be true. Does that change your decision on whether to take the meds? (This one only if they thought they were hallucinating): Is there any experience you could have of the ghost, without anyone else perceiving it, that would give it the same ontological status for you as other people? Let\u0026rsquo;s assume it\u0026rsquo;s too enigmatic to participate in experiments like having a friend write down a random number and asking the ghost what they wrote. I haven\u0026rsquo;t been formally tracking results, but here are some informal observations:\nA number of people said that their first response would be to assume that someone was playing a joke on them, which hadn\u0026rsquo;t even occurred to me. After that, people overwhelmingly thought that they were hallucinating. One person gave an 80% chance that ghosts existed after seeing one; only two people believed in ghosts a priori I found out that a lot of people have associations with the word \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo; that I don\u0026rsquo;t. I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t assume that a ghost was unfriendly, but virtually everyone I talked to did. A number of people also focused on the visual aspect of perceiving the ghost. A better way to communicate the question probably would have been \u0026ldquo;sensed a spirit,\u0026rdquo; but this seemed to me like it might scare people people off. But who knows - maybe people would be more willing to believe in a ghost that they could sense without seeing. People seem to have a healthy skepticism of psychiatric pharmacology. Among all the people I spoke with, none of them were willing to take the medication (the person who came closest wanted to try psychadelics and IFS therapy first). To quote someone who summed up responses here: \u0026ldquo;nahh seems sketchy.\u0026rdquo; The ghost\u0026rsquo;s predictions changed zero minds. Interestingly, this was true with regards to the medication, but also wrt the existence/nonexistence of the ghost: materialists remained solidly committed to materialism. None of the materialists I asked could be convinced that the ghost existed without experimentation of some sort. I\u0026rsquo;d also like to note that I\u0026rsquo;m an engineer, and most of my friends are also engineers. That\u0026rsquo;s a pretty big sampling bias.\nAlright, cool, so what\u0026rsquo;s the point of this? I\u0026rsquo;m interested in how (un)willing different people are to commit to their phenomenological experiences. One person I asked assigned an 80% probability to ghosts existing based on seeing one once. A number of people said they could never be convinced that ghosts exist without experimental evidence of some sort. What consequences do these views have? Are there better or worse ways to approach \u0026ldquo;magical\u0026rdquo; experiences?\nThe strategy I\u0026rsquo;m most interested in is 100% commitment to empiricism/materialism (I\u0026rsquo;ll drop the \u0026ldquo;materialism\u0026rdquo; from here for brevity and to avoid unwanted misinterpretation of materialism as consumerism). I suspect this strategy is over-represented in my sampling, but it\u0026rsquo;s interesting to me for reasons beyond its popularity. The big advantage of empiricism, particularly when you 100% commit to it, is that it\u0026rsquo;s self-consistent. The empiricist argument for rejecting an experience is something like: \u0026ldquo;I compare the probability that I\u0026rsquo;m hallucinating (base rate of hallucination given my individual priors) to some prior estimate of the probability that ghosts exist and one of them wants to talk to me. I find that the first probability is far greater than the second, and conclude that I am hallucinating.\u0026rdquo;\nEmpricism is probably the best tool out there for being right, but here\u0026rsquo;s my best shot at an argument against committing to it: sooner or later, most people have an experience that they can\u0026rsquo;t understand or reliably replicate. Some people have many. If you use empiricism to try to understand an experience like this, you will conclude that it was a hallucination, and you will need significantly more skill and subtlety to handle the experience in (what I\u0026rsquo;d consider) a healthy way.\nFor example, as an empiricist you could use a lens like IFS or Core Transformation, and interpret your experience as a hallucination created intentionally by some part of yourself that you don\u0026rsquo;t have direct access to (let\u0026rsquo;s say you accept these systems as useful metaphors, since I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen any studies confirming that they are literally true). If you take the correct approach towards your parts, you should take this hallucination seriously, and you can explore it by asking it questions, etc. Maybe you run into some issues with replicability, but we\u0026rsquo;ll ignore that. Aesthetically, though, this approach isn\u0026rsquo;t very empiricist and almost feels like a loophole to me. Every material thing you interact with is a mental formation whose internal state you can\u0026rsquo;t access - this approach lets you basically interact with hallucinations like they\u0026rsquo;re material objects without making an ontological commitment. But I think this lack of commitment is limiting. When we interact with a spirit, there is a chance of being knocked flat on our backs, of being completely destroyed, of being defeated and humbled by something older and vaster than ourselves. When I interact with a part, this possibility seems pretty remote.\nNow, there\u0026rsquo;s a very good chance this just means I\u0026rsquo;m doing IFS wrong or something - but that\u0026rsquo;s the point I\u0026rsquo;m trying to make. As an empiricist, I can put a great deal of time and effort into realizing increasingly nuanced conscious understanding of an idea, and if I\u0026rsquo;m very clever or have a good teacher I might eventually gain a level of understanding that allows me to interact with it skillfully. But by strategically relaxing my empiricism when I don\u0026rsquo;t feel that it\u0026rsquo;s useful, I have the opportunity to meet my phenomenological experience with openness and curiosity in a way that I just don\u0026rsquo;t think I could do if I was busy trying to figure out what makes it tick. Plus, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to deal with some of the weirdness that comes with selectively invalidating my own experiences. If you\u0026rsquo;re going to selectively invalidate your experiences, you need to be really, really careful about your priors, especially the ones related to what kinds of experiences are valid. By biasing towards updating based on experience, I can afford to be wrong more, which is slack I probably need.\nIdeally, I think, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t react to seeing a ghost by questioning its material existence in the first place - at least, not while I was having the experience. Even the question of whether something exists has a distinctly empirical flavor to me. The concept of existence itself brings in a bunch of tricky assumptions, so even just asking myself whether something exists might lead to modes of thought that aren\u0026rsquo;t useful for a mystical experience.\nA blogger asked Joshu, \u0026ldquo;If you saw a ghost, would you start believing in ghosts, or would you think you were hallucinating?\u0026rdquo;\nJoshu replied, \u0026ldquo;mu!\u0026rdquo;\nAnyway, I don\u0026rsquo;t mean to imply that there are right or wrong answers here. Empiricism plus skillful practice is probably at least as good as mysticism at promoting wholesome choices, and it has the benefit of being more explainable to a lot of people. I\u0026rsquo;m just saying that if you did want to fuck around and find out, I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t blame you.\n"

                "body": "In which I ramble until I run facefirst into Joshu\nA few anecdotes:\nI recently saw this Twitter thread, which basically said that the standard getting-to-know-you questions (\u0026ldquo;what do you do?\u0026rdquo;) are boring and came up with some much more thoughtful alternatives (\u0026ldquo;what have you been excited about lately?\u0026rdquo;). I liked Richard\u0026rsquo;s questions way, way more than the standard ones and was pretty excited to try them out. So I looked at the replies to the tweet and\u0026hellip; commenters mostly didn\u0026rsquo;t like them. Several people said they would come up with an excuse to get out of a conversation with someone who asked them one of these questions and avoid that person for the rest of the party. Huh.\nThis one happened a couple of years ago: a friend told me a story about how she went hiking out west and left the trail to find a spot to eat lunch. After she\u0026rsquo;d hiked for a while, she ran into someone who asked her to point them back to the parking lot. This person had gone hiking with no map, no water, and, apparently, no sense of direction or of the landscape, then left the trail to explore. My friend thought this was sort of funny/charming - I thought it was stupid and irresponsible. At the time, I described this to her as a sense that the person didn\u0026rsquo;t really respect nature.\nA few weeks ago, I discovered the excellent podcast The Emerald and the host, Josh, articulated my feelings about this perfectly. To paraphrase: there\u0026rsquo;s a modern-day tendency to romanticize nature as beautiful, friendly, and spiritually restorative. But while nature can be all of those things, that\u0026rsquo;s not all it is. Go anywhere on Earth and you are food. To plants, you\u0026rsquo;re food once your body decomposes. To animals, you\u0026rsquo;re food once they\u0026rsquo;ve eaten you or eaten something that has eaten you. Josh phrased is perfectly: \u0026ldquo;the forest wants to eat you.\u0026rdquo; Obviously, that\u0026rsquo;s not all it wants, but a clear-eyed relationship with nature needs to take this into account.\nI got the following story from the ACX Reader Review of The Anti-Politics Machine:\nA number of \u0026ldquo;development professionals\u0026rdquo; working for the World Bank decided to modernize the economy of Thaba-Tseka, Lesotho. They noticed that the people of Lesotho spent a lot of time raising cattle and planting crops, but didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to get a lot of income from selling their excess cattle and crops. Aha! An opportunity to introduce efficient markets! With a little basic infrastructure and economic restructuring, the farmers of Lesotho would be on their way to profitability. Except: it turned out that most of those people weren\u0026rsquo;t farmers. They were miners, and they kept cattle as part of a complex social system where cattle was mostly non-economic, except as a form of social insurance for those too old to work in the mines. Everyone knew where the market was, how to get there, and even the going rate for cattle - they just weren\u0026rsquo;t ranchers or farmers. So \u0026ldquo;developing the cattle market\u0026rdquo; ended up being one of the many huge wastes of money this project incurred.\nThis from the Uruk series review of Seeing Like a State. Seeing Like a State is an excellent book and the review is also valuable - I\u0026rsquo;ll lossily compress them here for brevity. The book is about how large organizations (the author, James C. Scott, focuses on states) need to simplify the world by creating legible abstractions. Governments, for example, ostensibly exist to facilitate human flourishing for their subjects (or, at least, this is the jusitification that seems most right to me). But \u0026ldquo;human flourishing\u0026rdquo; is extremely difficult to define or measure even at an individual scale, much less for a city or country. So the state creates abstractions like \u0026ldquo;the economy,\u0026rdquo; which is measured by \u0026ldquo;GDP\u0026rdquo; (the ideal legible abstraction compresses its target into a single number). Something that resists being compressed into a legible abstraction becomes, in a very real way, invisible to the state.\nAn interesting instance of this is evangelical conservatives. This bloc frequently voices their frustration with a decline in \u0026ldquo;church and family values.\u0026rdquo; When they do, they are ignored by virtually everyone except for a handful of politicians they elected. Note that this is not true for, eg, teaching creationism in public school, which is a concrete policy position that the state can see. Every now and then, though, someone comes along and says \u0026ldquo;oh, I know what\u0026rsquo;s going on here! Evangelical conservatives are upset because of the decline of manufacturing jobs in the Rust Belt.\u0026rdquo; And this gets plenty of attention from the large organizations that drive political discussion in the present day, and we have lots of lively debate about globalism while the evangelical conservatives get increasingly upset because they told us what they\u0026rsquo;re mad about, they\u0026rsquo;re mad about God and Family Values, and no one is taking them seriously. If you tell me at this point that actually manufacturing jobs are the problem, you are seeing like a state. Which isn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, you understand, it\u0026rsquo;s just not the only way to see.\nAnd different ways to see are what I\u0026rsquo;m trying to talk about in this essay. The common thread of these examples is that in each case, someone interacts with their idea of a thing rather than the thing itself, with serious consequences. Our ideas of a thing are usually comprised of all the ways in which that thing looks like something we have experience with - the human brain is an excellent and subtle pattern matcher. In each of the examples I gave above, it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to see the assumptions you\u0026rsquo;re making while you\u0026rsquo;re making them.\nFor example, I assumed that other people have more or less the same experience of party conversations as I do, because I\u0026rsquo;m the only person whose internal experience I\u0026rsquo;ve ever observed at a party. The problem isn\u0026rsquo;t that the reality isn\u0026rsquo;t obvious; of course other people experience parties differently than I do, the problem is that it never occurred to me to verify that. Even in the Lesotho example, the reality on the ground about how the Basotho (in case you were wondering about the plural form of \u0026ldquo;people from Lesotho\u0026rdquo;) view cattle would have been very obvious to someone who spent some time talking to them; they weren\u0026rsquo;t hiding anything.\nIt might be possible, for all I know, to come up with the perfect conversation questions ahead of time. I\u0026rsquo;m sure a lot of people have tried. I\u0026rsquo;m equally sure the World Bank has added the Lesotho example to a training PowerPoint somewhere. But I think the better way to go about things is to try to understand a situation on its own terms, which requires you to deliberately undermine your ideas about how it looks or should look. You can feel into where someone wants to take a conversation, or go to Lesotho for a few weeks and talk to the people there before you start trying to \u0026ldquo;develop\u0026rdquo; them. If, as you do this, you get obsessed with tiny details, really shake up your pattern matcher by diving into the particulars of this situation that make it unlike any other situation, you might stumble across something you never even knew to look for.\nAs a post-rationalist rule of thumb, this could probably be condensed as \u0026ldquo;simple approaches rarely do well in highly situated/contingent environments.\u0026rdquo; The reasoning behind approaches like looking for little details is that they let you start figuring out the environment instead of engineering an approach so general that it works in all environments. But it\u0026rsquo;s been phrased more beautifully by Zen Buddhism, which instructs us to always be mindful that we are complete beginners in the present moment, as there has never been a moment quite like this one.\nI like the \u0026ldquo;looking for details\u0026rdquo; formulation too, though, because it\u0026rsquo;s something concrete and fun for me to do. When I go for walks, I\u0026rsquo;ll use an app on my phone to identify whatever plants catch my eye - and I\u0026rsquo;ve been rewarded with the occasional excitement of discovering shared contexts with a new friend when I recognize a recently learned species in a different place. This has also affected my relationship with \u0026ldquo;nature,\u0026rdquo; which is evolving into a number of specific relationships with individual species.\nA monk spoke to Joshu, “I have just entered the monastery: please give me some guidance.”\nJoshu asked, “Have you had breakfast yet?”\nThe monk answered, “Yes I have eaten.”\nJoshu replied, “Then go wash your bowl.”\nAnd the monk was enlightened.\nI don\u0026rsquo;t want to sell this as a systematic fix. \u0026ldquo;Looking for details\u0026rdquo; doesn\u0026rsquo;t necessarily solve any problems on its own, not least because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t tell you what details to look for. But it\u0026rsquo;s something I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking about, and I\u0026rsquo;d like to offer it up as a useful spiritual practice/metasystematic heuristic, whatever suits you best.\n"

                "body": "A lens on telos from the angle of friendship\nI don\u0026rsquo;t spend much time thinking about the question of why are we here. This is partially because it seems sort of impossible to answer that question in a way that\u0026rsquo;s sensitive to the vast diversity of human experience. On the other hand, the nihilist response that there is no reason why we\u0026rsquo;re here feels like a cop-out; I think it\u0026rsquo;s probably wrong and definitely unhealthy. Also, I feel like I have a reasonable handle on why I\u0026rsquo;m here (or at least: on high-level guiding principles that are useful for guiding and aligning my actions), which makes the question of why everyone else is here a lot less important to me.\nBut it occurred to me that this question and another one might be useful lenses on one another. The other question is, \u0026ldquo;what is a friend?\u0026rdquo; Sociologists might answer this question by imposing a taxonomy of friendships - I see a lot of different splits suggested, but a lot of them like to distinguish between \u0026lsquo;activity friends\u0026rsquo; and \u0026rsquo;lifelong friends,\u0026rsquo; which seems fairly legitimate, though it appears to model friendship as a binary variable rather than a continuous one (how much can friendship intensity decrease after loss of a shared activity before that relationship is downgraded to the status of \u0026lsquo;activity friendship\u0026rsquo;?). It also seems to me that there\u0026rsquo;s at least a partial ordering of relationship quality that this taxonomic model suggests and then declines to analyze.\nAs someone who uncritically bought into some version of this taxonomic model and the value system that ships with it for a couple of years, I feel fairly comfortable categorizing it as a memetic hazard. I don\u0026rsquo;t think it\u0026rsquo;s necessarily wrong, it\u0026rsquo;s just not as nuanced or philisophically well-grounded in its usual packaging as it needs to be to make it safe.\nI\u0026rsquo;d like to introduce another lens which is, in my view, safer and healthier: a friend is someone with whom you are in a partnership that brings both of you closer to the reason you\u0026rsquo;re here. This idea isn\u0026rsquo;t original to me - in fact, it dates at least back to the ancient Greeks. The Greeks were nuts about taxonomies, they never met a concept they couldn\u0026rsquo;t break into at least two categories. In his Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle makes modern-day sociologists proud by giving what I might call a basis set for friendship. In his view, all friendships were based on some combination of three aspects:\nThe intrinsic goodness/quality/excellence (arete) the friends perceive in one another\nThe pleasure the friends derive from one another\nThe usefulness of the friendship to the friends\nArete is sort of important, so I\u0026rsquo;ll briefly define it: arete is usually translated as \u0026rsquo;excellence\u0026rsquo;, and refers to the effectiveness of a person or thing in fulfilling their purpose (telos). Arete implies a fulfillment of potential in service of an ultimate purpose. A person of arete is aligned towards that which is noble - morally, emotionally, and in their actions. For people, another translation might be \u0026ldquo;flourishing.\u0026rdquo;\nNow, just based on this information, Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s taxonomy is already better than just splitting friendships into categories, because he\u0026rsquo;s suggesting that all friendships contain all three of these aspects to different extents, which allows for a lot more nuance than choosing one of a preset number of boxes. But it gets better from here, because Aristotle imposes a value system just like the sociologists do - except he analyzes it transparently. In Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s view, only arete makes for durable/high-quality friendships. Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s idea of ideal friendships progresses like this:\nTwo people meet and recognize arete in one another. Being aligned towards that which is noble, they feel goodwill towards one another.\nEach person reconizes the goodwill that the other has towards them, and becomes personally invested in the arete of that person, associating it with their own arete. The friends love each other in the same way (though perhaps not to the same extent) as they love themselves.\nOK, we\u0026rsquo;ve covered arete, so it\u0026rsquo;s time to talk about anime now. I\u0026rsquo;m going to start with a disclaimer: I haven\u0026rsquo;t watched a huge amount of anime, and I know there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of variety. As I talk about anime in this essay, I\u0026rsquo;m referring to cherry-picked shows that were recommended to me by friends because those friends thought I would like them, which is a huge sampling bias.\nThat said: most action-genre anime I\u0026rsquo;ve seen has a trope where the main character makes a friend who constantly trains with them and pushes them to improve. The friends are constantly competing to \u0026ldquo;surpass\u0026rdquo; one another (it\u0026rsquo;s really interesting to me how certain words are way more common in anime than in other genres), and over the course of the show both become stronger and more moral as a result of their competition. Sometimes the entire main cast is working to keep up with each other.\nThe alignment of this relationship with the Aristotelian ideal is almost exact - the friends are completely committed to their own and one another\u0026rsquo;s arete, which they spend the show refining and clarifying. But, strangely, I can\u0026rsquo;t think of a single analogous relationship in US TV or movies - even though western intellectual tradition is ostensibly Greek in its lineage and Japanese intellectual tradition is not.\nInstead, it appears to me that the relationships in US TV are based on acceptance and osmosis. Friends accept each other, including each other\u0026rsquo;s flaws, and over some period of time they learn certain qualities from one another, usually by coincidence, which usually correspond to improvement of some sort. One example might be the shy character who is \u0026lsquo;adopted\u0026rsquo; by a more sociable friend and eventually learns the confidence to stand up for themselves. The friends accept each other exactly as they are, but end up improving anyway. My analysis of this is that it has a lot to do with West\u0026rsquo;s Disease - we want improvement to happen to us the way it happens to the characters in the movie; thus, the movie becomes a way for us to see our fantasies played out on the screen (cf: Sadly, Porn).\nAnyway, back to our original question of why we are here. If we assume that Aristotle is right and ideal friendships develop our arete (which is excellence in service of our telos), we can infer the answers that different cultures offer us from the nature of their idealized friendships. Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s answer is sort of circular: he thinks we\u0026rsquo;re here to develop and exercise our excellence - as individuals, in the many roles we play, and as humans generally. Like I said before, I don\u0026rsquo;t have strong opinions on the telos of humanity, but Aristotle\u0026rsquo;s view seems pretty well aligned with my own vague instinct. Similarly, anime frequently has a theme of applying deep perserverance to transcend limits.\nBut in popular US media, things get even more weirdly circular. The most common trajectory of even idealized friendships in US media, as far as I can tell, is one of becoming a better friend. The friends might improve in other ways, but they don\u0026rsquo;t set out to help each other in this - in fact, we often see the exact opposite, where one friend tries to help another improve and ends up learning to respect boundaries or accept his friend as he/she is. With some caveats, I don\u0026rsquo;t really care for this. Friendship for the purpose of being a better friend strikes me as form without function, barely a hair\u0026rsquo;s breadth away from the nihilist\u0026rsquo;s rejection of telos altogether.\nThe argument for this approach, I think, would be something like: \u0026ldquo;it\u0026rsquo;s not good to go into relationships with an agenda, you should accept people as they are.\u0026rdquo; I agree that you should try to accept people without forcing your values onto them - but people are constantly changing. Making a friend with the intention of fixing them is unhealthy, but making a friend with the intention of growing with them isn\u0026rsquo;t just healthy, it\u0026rsquo;s the only realistic thing you can do.\nAnd: there\u0026rsquo;s a lot to be said for agendalessness, but it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be confused with purposelessness. Sometimes, imposing our own agenda or preconceptions on a situation or interaction leads us to misunderstand, or even to do harm. But releasing your agenda should be done in service of some purpose; otherwise you\u0026rsquo;re just throwing up your hands and taking the easy way out. I\u0026rsquo;d like to see more purposeful relationships in the US and in US media - friendships based not just on mutual enjoyment and entertainment, but also on mutual recognition, nourishment, clarification, and even challenge.\n"
